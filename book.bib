	abstract = {Reviewers of research reports frequently criticize the choice of statistical methods. While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for “getting the wrong answer”.},

	url = {https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/23196},
	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a rule based cover type classification system for the forest and woodland vegetation in the Sky Islands of southeastern Arizona. In order to develop such a system we qualitatively and quantitatively compared a hierarchical (Ward’s) and a non-hierarchical (k-means) clustering method. Ecologically, unique groups represented by only a few plots were appropriately distinguished using k-means, while Ward’s combined these unique plots into the large mixed conifer groups. Similarly, plots dominated by more than one species were more appropriately grouped with other mixed-species plots using k-means. The two clustering methods were numerically compared using a classification and regression tree (CART) model. Groups based on the two clustering methods had similar recovery rates, but k-means groups required fewer nodes or decision rules. Based on these results we developed a detailed cover type classification system for the existing vegetation of the Sky Islands in southeastern Arizona. The final cover types were based on the original k-means clusters, with some minor modifications made using CART analysis to compensate for overlapping values. This allowed us to transform the CART output into a dichotomous identification key for 20 detailed cover types. Finally, these detailed cover types were linked to a flexible three-level hierarchical framework that allows users to aggregate or segregate forest lands as needed. The hierarchical organization of this framework is similar to the natural organization of ecosystems, which will aid our understanding of natural processes in these forest and woodlands.},

Although we inferred that these song differences were due to natural selection by the fly, other environmental differences among sampling localities may also influence the cricket song. To evaluate the contribution of parasitoid pressure to variation in song structure, we analysed calls of crickets from five areas arrayed along a gradient of prevalence of parasitization. A novel use of canonical correlation analysis allowed us to test simultaneously the robustness of alternative hypotheses and their predictions. There is strong inference that selection pressures by phonotactic parasitoid flies have shaped song characteristics of field crickets in the Hawaiian Islands. Not all song components appear to have been equally affected by parasitoid selection and approximately 80-90\% of total song variation among individuals is associated with other, unmeasured ecological and environmental attributes.},

	abstract = {Regional and ontogenetic variation in the contact calls of the kea (Nestor notabilis), an omnivorous and socially complex New Zealand parrot, were examined throughout the range of the species. We recorded samples of kee-ah contact calls from sixteen resident adults and eleven juveniles and demonstrated signiﬁcant differences between age classes in the acoustic form of the vocalization. Canonical correlation analysis revealed a gradient in the form of the kee-ah call in both adults and juveniles along and across the escarpment of the Southern Alps, the primary longitudinal mountain range on the South Island of New Zealand. Although the juvenile call varies geographically along the same axes as the adult version, the aspects of the call that vary geographically are strikingly different, suggesting that the variation results from independent processes of vocal learning in the two age classes. A similar analysis of squeal vocalizations, which are only produced by juveniles, found even greater levels of geographic variation. We suggest that the immediate social environment may serve as the primary factor shaping the vocal patterns of both juveniles and adults, producing localized homogeneity in call form within each age class.},

Statistical approaches included: Bartlett's test of sphericity; Bartlett's test of homogeneity of the correlation matrix, Lawley's test of the second A; bootstrapped confidence limits on successive As (i.e., significant differences between As); and bootstrapped confidence limits on eigenvector coefficients (i.e., coefficients that differ significantly from zero). All methods were compared using simulated data matrices of uniform correlation structure, patterned matrices of varying correlation structure and data sets of lake morphometry, water chemistry, and benthic invertebrate abundance. The most consistent results were obtained from the broken-stick model and a combined measure using bootstrapped As and associated eigenvector coefficients. The traditional and bootstrapped Kaiser-Guttman approaches overestimated the number of nontrivial dimensions as did the fixed-amount-of-variance model. The scree plot consistently estimated one dimension more than the number of simulated dimensions. Bartlett's test of sphericity showed inconsistent results. Both Bartlett's test of homogeneity of the correlation matrix and Lawley's test are limited to testing for only one and two dimensions, respectively.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis is one of the most widely applied tools in order to summarize common patterns of variation among variables. Several studies have investigated the ability of individual methods, or compared the performance of a number of methods, in determining the number of components describing common variance of simulated data sets. We identify a number of shortcomings related to these studies and conduct an extensive simulation study where we compare a larger number of rules available and develop some new methods. In total we compare 20 stopping rules and propose a two-step approach that appears to be highly effective. First, a Bartlett’s test is used to test the signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst principal component, indicating whether or not at least two variables share common variation in the entire data set. If signiﬁcant, a number of different rules can be applied to estimate the number of non-trivial components to be retained. However, the relative merits of these methods depend on whether data contain strongly correlated or uncorrelated variables. We also estimate the number of non-trivial components for a number of ﬁeld data sets so that we can evaluate the applicability of our conclusions based on simulated data.},

	abstract = {We used behavioural observations and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence analysis to examine demographic and genetic structure within and among home-range groups of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) ewes in the Peninsular Ranges of southern California, USA. We identified substantial genetic variation in the first 515 bp of the mtDNA control region and determined that seven haplotypes were distributed in a nonrandom fashion among these ewe subpopulations. Although a significant (P {\textless} 0.01) amount of mtDNA variation (33\%) was partitioned among home-range groups, we did not find strong evidence for matrilineal substructuring within these groups. Based on analyses of molecular variance, and comparisons of behavioural associations and distances between centres of activity, we concluded that within a given home-range group, bighorn sheep ewes generally associate with other ewes based on their availability rather than their matrilineal relationships. Our results also supported the conclusion that multiple ewe subpopulations exist within the Peninsular Ranges, and that these subpopulations are the most basic demographic and genetic units.},

	abstract = {Tree species in tropical rain forests exhibit a rich panoply of spatial patterns that beg ecological explanation. The analysis of tropical census data typically relies on spatial statistics, which quantify the average aggregation tendency of a species. In this article we develop a cluster-based approach that complements traditional spatial statistics in the exploration and analysis of ecological hypotheses for spatial pattern. We apply this technique to six study species within a fully mapped 50-ha forest census in peninsular Malaysia. For each species we identify the scale(s) of spatial aggregation and the corresponding tree clusters. We study the correlation between cluster locations and abiotic variables such as topography. We ﬁnd that the distribution of cluster sizes exhibits equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior depending on species life history. The distribution of tree diameters within clusters also varies according to species life history. At different spatial scales, we ﬁnd evidence for both niche-based and dispersal-limited processes producing spatial pattern. Our methodology for identifying scales of aggregation and clusters is general; we discuss the method’s applicability to spatial problems outside of tropical plant ecology.},

	abstract = {Bird populations in North America’s grasslands have declined sharply in recent decades. These declines are traceable, in large part, to habitat loss, but management of tallgrass prairie also has an impact. An indirect source of decline potentially associated with management is brood parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), which has had substantial negative impacts on many passerine hosts. Using a novel application of regression trees, we analyzed an extensive ﬁve-year set of nest data to test how management of tallgrass prairie affected rates of brood parasitism. We examined seven landscape features that may have been associated with parasitism: presence of edge, burning, or grazing, and distance of the nest from woody vegetation, water, roads, or fences. All ﬁve grassland passerines that we included in the analyses exhibited evidence of an edge effect: the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslow’s Sparrow (A. henslowii), Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna). The edge was represented by narrow strips of woody vegetation occurring along roadsides cut through tallgrass prairie. The sparrows avoided nesting along these woody edges, whereas the other three species experienced signiﬁcantly higher (1.9À5.33) rates of parasitism along edges than in prairie. The edge effect could be related directly to increase in parasitism rate with decreased distance from woody vegetation. After accounting for edge effect in these three species, we found evidence for signiﬁcantly higher (2.5À10.53) rates of parasitism in grazed plots, particularly those burned in spring to increase forage, than in undisturbed prairie. Regression tree analysis proved to be an important tool for hierarchically parsing various landscape features that affect parasitism rates. We conclude that, on the Great Plains, rates of brood parasitism are strongly associated with relatively recent road cuts, in that edge effects manifest themselves through the presence of trees, a novel habitat component in much of the tallgrass prairie. Grazing is also a key associate of increased parasitism. Areas managed with prescribed ﬁre, used frequently to increase forage for grazing cattle, may experience higher rates of brood parasitism. Regardless, removing trees and shrubs along roadsides and refraining from planting them along new roads may beneﬁt grassland birds.},

	abstract = {The avifauna of New Zealand underwent a large-scale extinction event before its discovery by Europeans. This extinction coincides with the colonization of New Zealand by the Maoris and it is currently thought that the decimation of the avifauna was a direct and indirect effect of this colonization. Some species were eliminated through direct hunting, while others probably fell prey to the pacific rat, Rattus exulans, which was introduced by the Maoris. The destruction of habitat by both the Maoris and the pacific rat may have also played a role. To date, there has been no systematic statistical analysis of the factors that characterize the species that went extinct and those that persisted. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical approach, the regression tree, for the analysis of such data. The purpose of the analysis is to generate a hierarchical predictive tree. The method establishes predictive characteristics from which causal mechansims can be hypothesized. Using regression tree analysis, we identify four main patterns in the avifaunal extinctions: (1) very large ({\textgreater} 3.75 kg) bird species all went extinct (whether volant or flightless); (2) the probability of flightless species less than 3.75 kg going extinct decreased with body size; (3) volant species nesting in cavities in the ground (petrels) showed a qualitatively similar pattern (i.e. probability of extinction decreased with body size); (4) in contrast, the probability of volant species nesting in other sites going extinct increased with body size. We discuss possible mechanisms that could generate these patterns.},

	abstract = {Reciprocal averaging is a technique of indirect ordination, related both to weighted averages and to principal components analysis and other eigenvector techniques. A series of tests with simulated community gradients (coenoclines), simulated community patterns (coenoplanes), and sets of vegetation samples was used to compare ordination performance of reciprocal averaging (RA) with non-standardized and standardized principal components analysis (PCA) and polar or Bray-Curtis ordination (PO). Of these, non-standardized PCA is most vulnerable to effects of beta diversity, giving distorted ordinations of sample sets with three or more half-changes. PO and RA give good ordinations to five or more half-changes, and standardized PCA is intermediate. Sample errors affect all these techniques more at low than at high beta diversity, but PCA is most vulnerable to effects of sample errors. All three techniques could ordinate well a small (1.5 x 1.5 half-changes) simulated community pattern; and PO and RA could ordinate larger patterns (4.5 x 4.5 half-changes) well. PCA distorts larger community patterns into complex surfaces. Given a rectangular pattern (1.5 x 4.5 halfchanges), RA distorts the major axis of sample variation into an arch in the second axis of ordination. Clusters of samples tend to distort PCA ordinations in rather unpredictable ways, but they have smaller effects on RA, and none on PO. Outlier samples do not affect PO (unless used as endpoints), but can cause marked deterioration in RA and PCA ordinations.},

It is, however, one of the most potentially misleading multivariate methods for community analysis. Inclusion of noisy or irrelevant environmental variables can distort the representation of gradients in community structure. These hazards are illustrated with simulated community data sets having a known, simple, underlying structure, then introducing different kinds and degrees of noise into the environmental data. Because of its sensitivity to even a modest amount of noise in the environmental data, CCA with site scores as linear combinations of environmental variables is inappropriate when the objective is to describe community structure. These problems can be avoided by using traditional indirect ordination methods, where pure community structure is expressed, without any constraint imposed by the environmental variables. CCA can be appropriate, however, when the objective is to describe how species respond to particular sets of observed environmental variables.},

The results, based on simulated coenoplane data showing varying degrees of species turnover on two independent environmental axes, suggested some strong differences between metric and nonmetric scaling methods in their ability to recover underlying nonlinear data structures. Prior data standardization had important effects on the results of both metric and nonmetric scaling, though the effect varied with the ordination method used. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling based on Euclidean distance following stand norm standardization proved to be the best strategy for recovering simulated coenoplane data. Of the metric strategies compared, correspondence analysis and the detrended form were the most successful. While detrending improved ordination configurations in some cases, in others it led to a distortion of results. It is suggested that none of the currently available ordination strategies is appropriate under all circumstances, and that future research in ordination methodology should emphasize a statistical rather than empirical approach.

If we fail to understand fully these fundamental concepts, then the scientific conclusions we reach are more likely to be wrong. This is more than supposition: for 60 years, statisticians have warned that the scientific literature harbors misunderstandings about basic statistical concepts. Original articles published in 1996 by the American Physiological Society’s journals fared no better in their handling of basic statistical concepts. In this review, we summarize the two main scientific uses of statistics: hypothesis testing and estimation. Most scientists use statistics solely for hypothesis testing; often, however, estimation is more useful. We also illustrate the concepts of variability and uncertainty, and we demonstrate the essential distinction between statistical significance and scientific importance. An understanding of concepts such as variability, uncertainty, and significance is necessary, but it is not sufficient; we show also that the numerical results of statistical analyses have limitations.},

To protect this system from the fate most statistical support systems suffer—somewhere on a lab shelf—we set out to find possible differences in conceptual models of experts and nonexperts by studying accounts by researchers on the method-choosing task. Results showed that there are important differences between the two models, the most important being the importance attributed to the research problem: Nonexperts tend to link the research problem as a whole directly to a method, whereas experts first of all categorize characteristics of the analysis problem. We conclude that there is a need to incorporate nonexperts' concepts into the statistical support system in order to support them in translating their view into the experts' view. After this translation the experts' concepts needed for solving the problem can be dealt with.

To do this, however, data needs to be analyzed in typically nontrivial refinement processes, which require technical expertise about methods and algorithms, experience with how a precise analysis should proceed, and knowledge about an exploding number of analytic approaches. To alleviate these problems, a plethora of different systems have been proposed that “intelligently” help users to analyze their data. This article provides a first survey to almost 30 years of research on intelligent discovery assistants (IDAs). It explicates the types of help IDAs can provide to users and the kinds of (background) knowledge they leverage to provide this help. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the systems developed over the past years, identifies their most important features, and sketches an ideal future IDA as well as the challenges on the road ahead.},

A key point is that, in spite of all the inconveniences and pitfalls, it may be a good alternative for the two parts, especially nowadays with all the internet facilities.

	abstract = {Biostatistical consulting is a service business. Although a consulting biostatistician's goal is long-term collaborative relationships with investigators, this is the same as the long-term goal of any business: having a group of contented, satisfied customers. In this era of constrained resources, we must be able to demonstrate that the benefit a biostatistical consulting group provides to its organization exceeds its actual cost to the institution. In this paper, I provide both a theoretical framework for assessing the value of a biostatistical service and provide an ad hoc method to value the contribution of a biostatistical service to a grant. Using the methods described, our biostatistics group returns more than \$6 for each dollar spent on institutional support in 1998. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The current state of using expert system (ES) techniques for statistics is expounded through the difficulties of defining the notion of statistical expert system (SES) and through several well-known examples. The main characteristics of statistical expertise, and particularly the important concept of strategy are emphasized. The current state of SESs is seen in the context of the global trend of the evolution of ES, i.e. within the growth of second generation expert system (SGESs). The knowledge base of these ESs represent an attempt to represent not only experts' knowledge but also the way experts acquire their expertise, thanks to the existence of an underlying model. We show through many examples how far SESs are and/or will be able to be SGESs.},

Topics include the role of subjectivity in the cycle of scientific inference and decisions, followed by a clinical trial and a greenhouse gas emissions case study that illustrate the role of judgments and the importance of basing them on objective information and a comprehensive uncertainty assessment.

	abstract = {In a digital era where terabytes of structured and unstructured records are created and stored every minute, the importance of collecting small amounts of high quality data is often undervalued. However, this activity plays a critical role in industrial and laboratory settings, when addressing problems from process modeling and analysis, to optimization and robust design. Implementing a screening design is usually the way to begin a systematic statistical Design of Experiments program. Its aim is to find the influential factors and establish a first description of the process under analysis. Recently, new developments have emerged in this field, especially with the appearance of a new class of designs that join screening efficiency with the possibility to estimate quadratic effects (definitive screening designs). Therefore, several alternatives are currently available for conducting screening studies, but information is still scarce on the pros and cons of each methodology. This study was thus designed to gather useful information from the user's perspective by independently considering each design with rather standard settings. For each design, its ability to recover the correct model structure was evaluated, through Monte Carlo simulations on several simulated process structures containing elements likely to be found in practice (they obey the general principles of effect sparsity, hierarchy, and heredity). As some screening designs can estimate quadratic terms, these effects were also considered in the simulated models, and three-level designs were brought to the analysis for comparison purposes, even though they are not screening designs.},

	abstract = {Over the past 2 years, increased focus on statistical analysis brought on by the era of big data has pushed the issue of reproducibility out of the pages of academic journals and into the popular consciousness (1). Just weeks ago, a paper about the relationship between tissue-specific cancer incidence and stem cell divisions (2) was widely misreported because of misunderstandings about the primary statistical argument in the paper (3). Public pressure has contributed to the massive recent adoption of reproducible research tools, with corresponding improvements in reproducibility. But an analysis can be fully reproducible and still be wrong. Even the most spectacularly irreproducible analyses—like those underlying the ongoing lawsuits (4) over failed genomic signatures for chemotherapy assignment (5)—are ultimately reproducible (6). Once an analysis is reproducible, the key question we want to answer is, “Is this data analysis correct?” We have found that the most frequent failure in data analysis is mistaking the type of question being considered.

	abstract = {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes’ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.},

	abstract = {Recent papers by Cardini et al. (Evolutionary Biology 46:307–316, 2019) and Bookstein (Evolutionary Biology 46:271–302, 2019) show that, when there are many variables and when sample sizes are small, scatterplots made using the between-groups principal components analysis method can appear to indicate clear group differences with little or no overlap between samples even though the samples are all drawn from a single multivariate normally distributed population. The corresponding scatterplots made after a canonical variates analysis (CVA) show an even more extreme separation of groups even though the usual test statistics yield the correct uniform distribution of probabilities. Users of CVA are usually concerned about the problems of small sample sizes and correlated variables but the problems discussed here are present even for large samples and uncorrelated variables. Some less-appreciated properties of sampling from high-dimensional spaces and the “curse of dimensionality” are reviewed to find a simple explanation for these problems. The ratio of variables to sample size is a useful index to predict when false clusters and these other problems may arise. While dependent upon the same variables, this index is not based on Marchenko and Pastur (Mathematics of the USSR–Sbornik 1:457–483, 1967) as discussed by Bookstein (Evolutionary Biology 44:522–541, 2017). It is also shown that multiple regression analysis can have related problems when there are large numbers of independent variables. The explanation for these problems is an incompatibility of showing both points separated by their full p-dimensional distances and low-dimensional projections of points in the same plot. Some implications for geometric morphometric and other multivariate analyses in biology are also discussed.},

New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

	url = {https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/#ref-leek2015question},
	abstract = {This textbook aims to be an approachable introduction to the world of data science. In this book, we define data science as the process of generating insight from data through reproducible and auditable processes. If you analyze some data and give your analysis to a friend or colleague, they should be able to re-run the analysis from start to finish and get the same result you did (reproducibility). They should also be able to see and understand all the steps in the analysis, as well as the history of how the analysis developed (auditability). Creating reproducible and auditable analyses allows both you and others to easily double-check and validate your work.

At a high level, in this book, you will learn how to

    identify common problems in data science, and
    solve those problems with reproducible and auditable workflows.

Figure 0.1 summarizes what you will learn in each chapter of this book. Throughout, you will learn how to use the R programming language (R Core Team 2021) to perform all the tasks associated with data analysis. You will spend the first four chapters learning how to use R to load, clean, wrangle (i.e., restructure the data into a usable format) and visualize data while answering descriptive and exploratory data analysis questions. In the next six chapters, you will learn how to answer predictive, exploratory, and inferential data analysis questions with common methods in data science, including classification, regression, clustering, and estimation. In the final chapters (11–13), you will learn how to combine R code, formatted text, and images in a single coherent document with Jupyter, use version control for collaboration, and install and configure the software needed for data science on your own computer. If you are reading this book as part of a course that you are taking, the instructor may have set up all of these tools already for you; in this case, you can continue on through the book reading the chapters in order. But if you are reading this independently, you may want to jump to these last three chapters early before going on to make sure your computer is set up in such a way that you can try out the example code that we include throughout the book.
Where are we going?

Figure 0.1: Where are we going?

Each chapter in the book has an accompanying worksheet that provides exercises to help you practice the concepts you will learn. We strongly recommend that you work through the worksheet when you finish reading each chapter before moving on to the next chapter. All of the worksheets are available at https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/data-science-a-first-intro-worksheets\#readme; the “Exercises” section at the end of each chapter points you to the right worksheet for that chapter. For each worksheet, you can either launch an interactive version of the worksheet in your browser by clicking the “launch binder” button, or preview a non-interactive version of the worksheet by clicking “view worksheet.” If you instead decide to download the worksheet and run it on your own machine, make sure to follow the instructions for computer setup found in Chapter 13. This will ensure that the automated feedback and guidance that the worksheets provide will function as intended.},

	abstract = {Understanding factors that contribute to song divergence bolsters our understanding of signal evolution and reproductive isolation. Hybrid zones often occur across environmental gradients; as such, they are excellent places to examine how signals diverge and how differentiation is maintained. We studied song variation across two hybrid zones, one old and one recent, of Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Black-crested Titmouse (B. atricristatus), across an environmental gradient where the two titmouse populations meet. In the recent zone, noise and vegetation structure were correlated with several song characteristics, but in the older zone, these features did not correlate despite similar gradients in song features. Our data, combined with previous studies, suggest that despite overall similarities in characteristics, songs in the older zone may be more shaped by sexual selection, whereas songs in the young zone are shaped by environment. Thus, even within the same species, processes shaping signal structure can vary spatially and temporally.},

I review some of the more persistent criticisms of P values and argue that most stem from misunderstandings or incorrect interpretations, rather than from intrinsic shortcomings of the P value. I show that P values are intimately linked to conﬁdence intervals and to differences in Akaike’s information criterion (DAIC), two metrics that have been advocated as replacements for the P value. The choice of a threshold value of DAIC that breaks ties among competing models is as arbitrary as the choice of the probability of a Type I error in hypothesis testing, and several other criticisms of the P value apply equally to DAIC. Since P values, conﬁdence intervals, and DAIC are based on the same statistical information, all have their places in modern statistical practice. The choice of which to use should be stylistic, dictated by details of the application rather than by dogmatic, a priori considerations.},

	abstract = {Three flawed practices associated with model averaging coefficients for predictor variables in regression models commonly occur when making multimodel inferences in analyses of ecological data. Model-averaged regression coefficients based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights have been recommended for addressing model uncertainty but they are not valid, interpretable estimates of partial effects for individual predictors when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Multicollinearity implies that the scaling of units in the denominators of the regression coefficients may change across models such that neither the parameters nor their estimates have common scales, therefore averaging them makes no sense. The associated sums of AIC model weights recommended to assess relative importance of individual predictors are really a measure of relative importance of models, with little information about contributions by individual predictors compared to other measures of relative importance based on effects size or variance reduction. Sometimes the model-averaged regression coefficients for predictor variables are incorrectly used to make model-averaged predictions of the response variable when the models are not linear in the parameters. I demonstrate the issues with the first two practices using the college grade point average example extensively analyzed by Burnham and Anderson. I show how partial standard deviations of the predictor variables can be used to detect changing scales of their estimates with multicollinearity. Standardizing estimates based on partial standard deviations for their variables can be used to make the scaling of the estimates commensurate across models, a necessary but not sufficient condition for model averaging of the estimates to be sensible. A unimodal distribution of estimates and valid interpretation of individual parameters are additional requisite conditions. The standardized estimates or equivalently the t statistics on unstandardized estimates also can be used to provide more informative measures of relative importance than sums of AIC weights. Finally, I illustrate how seriously compromised statistical interpretations and predictions can be for all three of these flawed practices by critiquing their use in a recent species distribution modeling technique developed for predicting Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) distribution in Colorado, USA. These model averaging issues are common in other ecological literature and ought to be discontinued if we are to make effective scientific contributions to ecological knowledge and conservation of natural resources.},

	abstract = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a widely used non-parametric data analytic tool discriminatory power of which is dependent on the homogeneity of the domain of the sample. In many real-life cases, however, the sample of the decision making units (DMU) could consist of two or more naturally occurring subsets, thus exhibiting clear signs of heterogeneity. In such situations, the discriminatory power of DEA is limited, for the nature of the relative efficiency of a DMU is likely to be influenced by its membership in a particular subset of the sample. In this study, we propose a three-step methodology allowing for increasing the discriminatory power of DEA in the presence of the heterogeneity of the sample. In the first phase, we use cluster analysis (CA) in order to test for the presence of the naturally occurring subsets in the sample. In the second phase DEA is used to calculate the relative efficiencies of the DMUs, as well as averaged relative efficiencies of each subset identified in the previous phase. Finally, we utilize decision tree (DT) induction in order to inquire into the subset-specific nature of the relative efficiencies of the DMUs in the sample. Illustrative example is provided.},

	abstract = {In a previous post, I described how decision tree algorithms work and demonstrated their use via the rpart library in R. Decision trees work by splitting a dataset recursively. That is, subsets arising from a split are further split until a predetermined termination criterion is reached.  At each step, a split is made based on the independent variable that results in the largest possible reduction in heterogeneity of the dependent  variable.

(Note:  readers unfamiliar with decision trees may want to read that post before proceeding)

The main drawback of decision trees is that they are prone to overfitting.   The  reason for this is that trees, if grown deep, are able to fit  all kinds of variations in the data, including noise. Although it is possible to address this partially by pruning, the result often remains less than satisfactory. This is because the algorithm makes a locally optimal choice at each split without any regard to whether the choice made is the best one overall.  A poor split made in the initial stages can thus doom the model, a problem that cannot be fixed by post-hoc pruning.

In this post I describe random forests, a tree-based algorithm that addresses the above shortcoming of decision trees. I’ll first describe the intuition behind the algorithm via an analogy and then do a demo using the R randomForest library.},

Such models can be valuable tools to understand the biogeography of species and to support the prediction of its presence/absence considering a particular environment scenario. This paper investigates the use of different supervised machine learning techniques to model the potential distribution of 35 plant species from Latin America. Each technique was able to extract a different representation of the relations between the environmental conditions and the distribution profile of the species. The experimental results highlight the good performance of random trees classifiers, indicating this particular technique as a promising candidate for modelling species’ potential distribution.},

We compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in high-dimensionality data settings. We evaluate the effects of varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset, imbalance in class distribution and choice of metric for quantifying performance of the classifier.

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) have become an essential tool in ecology, biogeography, evolution and, more recently, in conservation biology. How to generalize species distributions in large undersampled areas, especially with few samples, is a fundamental issue of SDMs. In order to explore this issue, we used the best available presence records for the Hooded Crane (Grus monacha, n = 33), White-naped Crane (Grus vipio, n = 40), and Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis, n = 75) in China as three case studies, employing four powerful and commonly used machine learning algorithms to map the breeding distributions of the three species: TreeNet (Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Boosted Regression Tree Model), Random Forest, CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Maxent (Maximum Entropy Models). In addition, we developed an ensemble forecast by averaging predicted probability of the above four models results. Commonly used model performance metrics (Area under ROC (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS)) were employed to evaluate model accuracy. The latest satellite tracking data and compiled literature data were used as two independent testing datasets to confront model predictions. We found Random Forest demonstrated the best performance for the most assessment method, provided a better model fit to the testing data, and achieved better species range maps for each crane species in undersampled areas. Random Forest has been generally available for more than 20 years and has been known to perform extremely well in ecological predictions. However, while increasingly on the rise, its potential is still widely underused in conservation, (spatial) ecological applications and for inference. Our results show that it informs ecological and biogeographical theories as well as being suitable for conservation applications, specifically when the study area is undersampled. This method helps to save model-selection time and effort, and allows robust and rapid assessments and decisions for efficient conservation.},

We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a lot of interest in “ensemble learning” — methods that generate many classifiers and aggregate their results. Two well-known methods are boosting (see, e.g., Shapire et al., 1998) and bagging Breiman (1996) of classification trees. In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction. In bagging, successive trees do not depend on earlier trees — each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set. In the end, a simple majority vote is taken for prediction. Breiman (2001) proposed random forests, which add an additional layer of randomness to bagging. In addition to constructing each tree using a different bootstrap sample of the data, random forests change how the classification or regression trees are constructed. In standard trees, each node is split using the best split among all variables. In a random forest, each node is split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node. This somewhat counterintuitive strategy turns out to perform very well compared to many other classifiers, including discriminant analysis, support vector machines and neural networks, and is robust against overfitting (Breiman, 2001). In addition, it is very user-friendly in the sense that it has only two parameters (the number of variables in the random subset at each node and the number of trees in the forest), and is usually not very sensitive to their values. The randomForest package provides an R interface to the Fortran programs by Breiman and Cutler (available at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/ users/breiman/). This article provides a brief introduction to the usage and features of the R functions.},

	abstract = {1. Researchers frequently take repeated measurements of individuals in a sample with the goal of quantifying the proportion of the total variation that can be attributed to variation among individuals vs. variation among measurements within individuals. The proportion of the variation attributed to variation among individuals is known as repeatability and is most frequently estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The goal of our study is to provide guidelines for determining the sample size (number of individuals and number of measurements per individual) required to accurately estimate the ICC. 2. We report a range of ICCs from the literature and estimate 95\% confidence intervals for these estimates. We introduce a predictive equation derived by Bonett (2002), and we test the assumptions of this equation through simulation. Finally, we create an R statistical package for the planning of experiments and estimation of ICCs. 3. Repeatability estimates were reported in 1·5\% of the articles published in the journals surveyed. Repeatabilities tended to be highest when the ICC was used to estimate measurement error and lowest when it was used to estimate repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Few authors report confidence intervals, but our estimated 95\% confidence intervals for published ICCs generally indicated a low level of precision associated with these estimates. This survey demonstrates the need for a protocol to estimate repeatability. 4. Analysis of the predictions from Bonett’s equation over a range of sample sizes, expected repeatabilities and desired confidence interval widths yields both analytical and intuitive guidelines for designing experiments to estimate repeatability. However, we find a tendency for the confidence interval to be underestimated by the equation when ICCs are high and overestimated when ICCs and the number of measurements per individual are low. 5. The sample size to use when estimating repeatability is a question pitting investigator effort against expected precision of the estimate. We offer guidelines that apply over a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary studies estimating repeatability, measurement error or heritability. Additionally, we provide the R package, icc, to facilitate analyses and determine the most economic use of resources when planning experiments to estimate repeatability.},

Variability of each measurement, as well as covariability between pairs of measurements, was partitioned into among- and within-snail (i.e., measurement error) components. The \%ME varied by two orders of magnitude across the ten measurement variables considered. Shell weight had the lowest \%ME (0.059\%), while body whorl height had the highest (3.88\%). There was a low correlation between \%ME and the among-snail coefficient of variation for each variable (r = −0.28; P {\textgreater} 0.20). Within-snail correlations between pairs of measurement variables were uniformly low (rwithin ≤ 0.20), while among-snail correlations were generally very high (r = 0.74 to 0.99) due to the large size range of snails in the sample. In any morphometric study, if \%ME is found to be high for a particular variable, it should either be deleted from the study or remeasured a number of times on every individual to be included in the dataset.},

	abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the ﬂexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

	abstract = {The Mantel test, based on comparisons of distance matrices, is commonly employed in comparative biology, but its statistical properties in this context are unknown. Here, we evaluate the performance of the Mantel test for two applications in comparative biology: testing for phylogenetic signal, and testing for an evolutionary correlation between two characters. We find that the Mantel test has poor performance compared to alternative methods, including low power and, under some circumstances, inflated type-I error. We identify a remedy for the inflated type-I error of three-way Mantel tests using phylogenetic permutations; however, this test still has considerably lower power than independent contrasts. We recommend that use of the Mantel test should be restricted to cases in which data can only be expressed as pairwise distances among taxa.},

	abstract = {Recently, multiple studies have reported declining phenological sensitivities (∆ days per ℃) with higher temperatures. Such observations have been used to suggest climate change is reshaping biological processes, with major implications for forecasts of future change. Here, we show that these results may simply be the outcome of using linear models to estimate nonlinear temperature responses, specifically for events that occur after a cumulative thermal threshold is met—a common model for many biological events. Corrections for the nonlinearity of temperature responses consistently remove the apparent decline. Our results show that rising temperatures combined with linear estimates based on calendar time produce the observations of declining sensitivity—without any shift in the underlying biology. Current methods may thus undermine efforts to identify when and how warming will reshape biological processes.},

In addition, it considers special data structures like high-dimensional compositions and compositional tables. The methodology introduced is also frequently compared to methods which ignore the specific nature of compositional data. It focuses on practical aspects of compositional data analysis rather than on detailed theoretical derivations, thus issues like graphical visualization and preprocessing (treatment of missing values, zeros, outliers and similar artifacts) form an important part of the book. Since it is primarily intended for researchers and students from applied fields like geochemistry, chemometrics, biology and natural sciences, economics, and social sciences, all the proposed methods are accompanied by worked-out examples in R using the package robCompositions.},

In an experiment (N ¼ 217), we manipulated professors’ mindset beliefs (fixed vs. growth) within a course syllabus. While both men and women perceived the fixed mindset professor to endorse more gender stereotypes and anticipated feeling less belonging in the course, women reported these effects more than men. However, only for women did this threat undermine performance. In a 2-year longitudinal field study (884 students enrolled in 46 STEM courses), students who perceived their professor to endorse a fixed (vs. growth) mindset thought the professor would endorse more gender stereotypes and experienced less belonging in those courses. However, only women’s grades in those courses suffered as a result. Together, these studies demonstrate that professors’ fixed mindset beliefs may trigger stereotype threat among women in STEM courses.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are used to classify and predict the alteration facies of the Rosemont skarn deposit. The deposit comprises three major geological domains informally named the Lower Plate, Upper Plate, and West Block. Over 1 billion tons of Cu-Mo-Ag mineralization are primarily hosted within the Lower Plate and West Block, concealed under poorly mineralized rocks of the Upper Plate. A training dataset comprising 882 drill core samples analyzed for X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) mineralogy and multi-element geochemistry is used to improve the classification and recognition of the skarn alteration. The XRD-mineralogy is used for unsupervised learning in which hierarchical and K-means cluster analysis is applied to devise a classification of the skarn alteration using a compositional data analysis approach. The complex alteration at the Rosemont deposit is simplified into garnet-pyroxene-wollastonite-vesuvianite (GrtPxWoVes) skarn, serpentine-amphibole (SrpAm) skarn, epidote (Ep) skarn, and least altered (LAlt) rock. These four classes are coded into a categorical variable named Alteration Facies. The supervised learning uses the multi-element geochemical data to predict Alteration Facies. Several predictive models are fitted using different machine learning algorithms including support vector machines with linear (SVM-linear) and radial (SVM-radial) kernels, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forests (RF). Each predictive model is fitted onto three predictor spaces including raw geochemical data, isometric log-ratios (ilr), and centered log-ratios (clr) to evaluate the effect of compositional representations on the performance of the predictive models. The analysis shows that the RF algorithm yields predictive models that outperform all other algorithms using any of the predictor spaces. The RF test set prediction accuracy after 10-fold cross-validation is 79\%; which is significantly higher than an accuracy of 45\% obtained from visual core logging classification of the skarn alteration. Hypothesis testing, using multilevel linear modeling, suggests that there are no statistically significant differences in the quality of the predictive models fitted onto the raw, ilr, and clr geochemical data. Therefore, compositional representations of the geochemical data do not improve the performance of the predictive models. The best RF model is used to predict Alteration Facies on 33,000 drill core samples in which multi-element geochemistry is available but the skarn alteration is uncertain due to the lack of XRD-mineralogy. The predicted alteration shows that the Ep skarn facies occurs above the economic mineralization within Mesozoic siliciclastic and volcanic rocks of the Upper plate. The GrtPxWoVes skarn and SrpAm skarn occur within Paleozoic carbonate rocks of the Lower Plate and West Block. Accordingly, the Ep skarn facies can be used to target blind Cu-Mo-Ag rich porphyry-skarn mineralization in areas where the Paleozoic carbonate rocks are concealed under the Mesozoic siliciclastic and volcanic rocks.},

	abstract = {Compositional data (almost all data in geochemistry) are closed data, that is they usually sum up to a constant (e.g. weight percent, wt.\%) and carry only relative information. Thus, the covariance structure of compositional data is strongly biased and results of many multivariate techniques become doubtful without a proper transformation of the data. The centred logratio transformation (clr) is often used to open closed data. However the transformed data do not have full rank following a logratio transformation and cannot be used for robust multivariate techniques like principal component analysis (PCA). Here we propose to use the isometric logratio transformation (ilr) instead. However, the ilr transformation has the disadvantage that the resulting new variables are no longer directly interpretable in terms of the originally entered variables. Here we propose a technique how the resulting scores and loadings of a robust PCA on ilr transformed data can be back-transformed and interpreted. The procedure is demonstrated using a real data set from regional geochemistry and compared to results from non-transformed and non-robust versions of PCA. It turns out that the procedure using ilr-transformed data and robust PCA delivers superior results to all other approaches. The examples demonstrate that due to the compositional nature of geochemical data PCA should not be carried out without an appropriate transformation. Furthermore a robust approach is preferable if the dataset contains outliers. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this work, a parametric approach for replacing data below the detection limit, also known as rounded zeros, in compositional data sets is proposed. Compositional rounded zeros correspond to small proportions of some whole that cannot be reliably detected by the analytical instruments under given operating conditions. This kind of zeros appear frequently in the data collection process in geosciences. They must be treated in an adequate way before some multivariate analysis can be applied. Our procedure results from a modiﬁcation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and is based on the additive log-ratio transformation. Its coherence with the nature of compositional data and with basic operations in the simplex sample space is checked. Using real data sets, we ﬁnd that this approach improves other parametric and non-parametric techniques for compositional rounded zeros.},

	abstract = {Geochemical studies typically generate data sets including labels for values below certain limits of detection of the analytical techniques involved. These unobserved values hamper subsequent data analysis, and a number of procedures with different levels of sophistication have been introduced in order to deal with them. Unfortunately, those most commonly used in practice are those most prone to introduce bias and lead to poor estimates of the statistics of interest. We approach this topic in the context of geochemical compositional data, that is, data representing parts of a whole. Although the general statistical literature has provided well-based methods for censored data, which includes the case of nondetects, they have ignored the special nature of compositional samples. In this paper we review a number of methods introduced in the recent years to deal with values below the detection limit while meeting compositional principles. We provide guidance and computer routines to easily apply them in practice using the popular R statistical computing language.},

	abstract = {About the Book

We hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.

(1) Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications.

(2) You don't have to be a math guru to learn from interesting, real data.

(3) Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. However, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn interesting things about the world.

Textbook overview

The chapters of this book are as follows:
1. Introduction to data. Data structures, variables, summaries, graphics, and basic data collection techniques.
2. Foundations for inference. Case studies are used to introduce the ideas of statistical inference with randomization and simulations. The content leads into the standard parametric framework, with techniques reinforced in the subsequent chapters.1
It is also possible to begin with this chapter and introduce tools from Chapter 1 as they
are needed.
3. Inference for categorical data. Inference for proportions using the normal and chi-square distributions, as well as simulation and randomization techniques.
4. Inference for numerical data. Inference for one or two sample means using the t distribution, and also comparisons of many means using ANOVA. A special section for bootstrapping is provided at the end of the chapter.
5. Introduction to linear regression. An introduction to regression with two variables. Most of this chapter could be covered immediately after Chapter 1.
6. Multiple and logistic regression. An introduction to multiple regression and logistic regression for an accelerated course.

Appendix A. Probability. An introduction to probability is provided as an optional reference. Exercises and additional probability content may be found in Chapter 2 of OpenIntro Statistics at openintro.org. Instructor feedback suggests that probability, if discussed, is best introduced at the very start or very end of the course.},

	abstract = {The availability of user-friendly software and publicly available biodiversity databases has led to a rapid increase in the use of ecological niche modelling to predict species distributions. A potential source of error in publicly available data that may affect the accuracy of ecological niche models (ENMs), and one that is difficult to correct for, is incorrect (or incomplete) taxonomy. Here we remind researchers of the need for careful evaluation of database records prior to use in modelling, especially when the presence of cryptic species is suspected or many records are based on indirect evidence. To draw attention to this potential problem, we construct ENMs for the North American Sasquatch (i.e. Bigfoot). Specifically, we use a large database of georeferenced putative sightings and footprints for Sasquatch in western North America, demonstrating how convincing environmentally predicted distributions of a taxon’s potential range can be generated from questionable site-occurrence data. We compare the distribution of Bigfoot with an ENM for the black bear, Ursus americanus, and suggest that many sightings of this cryptozoid may be cases of mistaken identity.},

We explain that anova calculates the sum of squares for each term in the model formula sequentially (type I sums of squares) and show how anova tables of adjusted sums of squares are composite tables assembled from multiple sequential analyses. A different anova is performed for each explanatory variable or interaction so that each term is placed last in the model formula in turn and adjusted for the others. 3. The sum of squares for each term in the analysis can be calculated after adjusting only for the main effects of other explanatory variables (type II sums of squares) or, controversially, for both main effects and interactions (type III sums of squares). 4. We summarize the main recent developments and emphasize the shift away from the search for the ‘right’anova table in favour of presenting one or more models that best suit the objectives of the analysis.},

	url = {http://ordination.okstate.edu/},
	abstract = {Ordination is a widely-used family of methods which attempts to reveal the relationships between ecological communities. For definitions, go HERE.

This ordination web page is designed to address some of the most frequently asked questions about ordination. It is my intention to gear this page towards the student and the practitioner rather than the ordination specialist, so please contact me if the jargon is unintelligible!

The ecological literature is filled with papers describing, contrasting, and modifying existing ordination techniques. Then why is an ordination web page needed? My main motivation is based upon the following observation: many of us, when we start to use ordination methods, make the same simple mistakes. If we are good scientists, we will learn from our own mistakes. But wouldn't it save a lot of time if we could also learn from other people's mistakes?

It turns out that there are a number of frequently asked questions concerning ordination, as well as a number of "tricks of the trade" and "rules of thumb". It is probably not worthwhile filling the pages of our scientific journals with such rules; many of them are quite trivial. However, the Web, which is easy to update, modify, and rearrange, is an ideal forum for presenting such ideas.

As in any scientific endeavor, the field of ordination methodology is filled with conflicting opinions and world views. While I try to be objective, it is difficult to remain completely detached. I would like this to be an open forum! Please send in your comments, reactions, flames, questions, etc. if you would like to see them included in the web page! I am also very eager to accept new text and suggested links.

This web page continues to be under construction. I started with some commonly-encountered issues with respect to Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), which is probably the most widely used ordination technique today. I then expanded the page to cover other ordination methods.  I would be happy to entertain suggestions as to how to expand or modify this page in the future. This website is designed, in part, as instructional material for a graduate-level ordination course, taught in Falls of odd-numbered years, at Oklahoma State University.  However, this website is not to be considered a textbook, nor a comprehensive reference source.  Please refer to suggested references for self-education to pave the way for a more thorough appreciation of ordination methods.},

	abstract = {Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour, and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources. Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias: an instance of the Big Data Paradox1. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi–Facebook2,3 (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse4 (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi–Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14–20 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11–17 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios–Ipsos online panel5 with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices6 provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework1 to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition.},

	abstract = {Bayesian modeling has become an indispensable tool for ecological research because it is uniquely suited to deal with complexity in a statistically coherent way. This textbook provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the latest Bayesian methods--in language ecologists can understand. Unlike other books on the subject, this one emphasizes the principles behind the computations, giving ecologists a big-picture understanding of how to implement this powerful statistical approach. Bayesian Models is an essential primer for non-statisticians. It begins with a definition of probability and develops a step-by-step sequence of connected ideas, including basic distribution theory, network diagrams, hierarchical models, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and inference from single and multiple models. This unique book places less emphasis on computer coding, favoring instead a concise presentation of the mathematical statistics needed to understand how and why Bayesian analysis works. It also explains how to write out properly formulated hierarchical Bayesian models and use them in computing, research papers, and proposals. This primer enables ecologists to understand the statistical principles behind Bayesian modeling and apply them to research, teaching, policy, and management. Presents the mathematical and statistical foundations of Bayesian modeling in language accessible to non-statisticians Covers basic distribution theory, network diagrams, hierarchical models, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and more Deemphasizes computer coding in favor of basic principles Explains how to write out properly factored statistical expressions representing Bayesian models},

Frequently implemented as Web and mobile applications, they provide access to community resources such as software, data, collaboration tools, instrumentation, and high-performance computing. We anticipate opportunities for growth within a fragmented community. Through a large-scale survey, we measured the extent and characteristics of the gateway community (reliance on gateways and nature of existing resources) to understand useful services and support for builders and users. We administered an online survey to nearly 29,000 principal investigators, senior administrators, and people with gateway affiliations. Nearly 5000 respondents represented diverse expertise and geography. The majority of researchers/educators indicated that specialized online resources were important to their work. They choose technologies by asking colleagues and looking for documentation, demonstrated reliability, and technical support; adaptability via customizing or open-source standards was another priority. Research groups commonly provide their own resources, but public/academic institutions and commercial services also provide substantial offerings. Application creators and administrators welcome external services providing guidance such as technology selection, sustainability planning, evaluation, and specialized expertise (e.g., quality assurance and design). Technologies are diverse, so flexibility and ongoing community input are essential, as is offering specific, easy-to-access training, community support, and professional development.

	abstract = {Mounting failures of replication in social and biological sciences give a new urgency to critically appraising proposed reforms. This book pulls back the cover on disagreements between experts charged with restoring integrity to science. It denies two pervasive views of the role of probability in inference: to assign degrees of belief, and to control error rates in a long run. If statistical consumers are unaware of assumptions behind rival evidence reforms, they can't scrutinize the consequences that affect them (in personalized medicine, psychology, etc.). The book sets sail with a simple tool: if little has been done to rule out flaws in inferring a claim, then it has not passed a severe test. Many methods advocated by data experts do not stand up to severe scrutiny and are in tension with successful strategies for blocking or accounting for cherry picking and selective reporting. Through a series of excursions and exhibits, the philosophy and history of inductive inference come alive. Philosophical tools are put to work to solve problems about science and pseudoscience, induction and falsification.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology. In theory, SDMs capture (at least part of) species' ecological niches and can be used to make inferences about the distribution of suitable habitat for species of interest. Because habitat suitability is expected to influence population demography, SDMs have been used to estimate a variety of population parameters, from occurrence to genetic diversity. However, a critical look at the ability of SDMs to predict independent data across different aspects of population biology is lacking. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature, retrieving 201 studies that tested predictions from SDMs against independent assessments of occurrence, abundance, population performance, and genetic diversity. Although there is some support for the ability of SDMs to predict occurrence ( 53\% of studies depending on how support was assessed), the predictive performance of these models declines progressively from occurrence to abundance, to population mean fitness, to genetic diversity. At the same time, we observed higher success among studies that evaluated performance for single versus multiple species, pointing to a possible publication bias. Thus, the limited accuracy of SDMs reported here may reflect the best-case scenario. We discuss the limitations of these models and provide specific recommendations for their use for different applications going forward. However, we emphasize that predictions from SDMs, especially when used to inform conservation decisions, should be treated as hypotheses to be tested with independent data rather than as stand-ins for the population parameters we seek to know.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

The proposed model is useful for situation where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0,1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expression for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

Alternatively, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as ‘JAGS’, ‘STAN’, or ‘BUGS’ can be processed as well. The resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression.

	abstract = {Last week I wrote about the relationship between weight and height in US adults, as seen in the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an annual telephone survey of around 400,000 interviews per year. In particular, I tested the widely-circulated claim that Body Mass Index (BMI) exaggerates the “fatness” of tall people because empirically (it is claimed), weight is proportional to height to the power of 2.5, not to 2.0 as implied by the formula for calculating BMI. I showed that in 2018 in the BRFSS at least, weight is actually proportional to height to the power of around 1.6 (after adjusting for race and sex). So if anything, the BMI calculation exaggerates the weight of short people, not tall people, on the logic of the original critique. I have a couple of follow-up points today: whether it is best to to logarithm-transform a response variable in a particular model, or model it on its original scale and use a logarithm link function in a generalized linear model whether socioeconomic class is a confounding variable (richer people are taller, and also healthier in general, so perhaps the relatively low weights of tall people measured by the BMI are caused by the better health of rich people, not by a problem in the measurement). Let’s deal with those one at a time. Log transform or log link? Our height and weight data looks a bit like this (limiting ourselves to a random sub-sample of the full survey to better illustrate a point without over-plotting): There is a very slight curvature (not really visible) in the relationship between height and weight, but more importantly (if one is considering estimating a model by ordinary least squares) there is a clear “fanning out” effect - as the expected value of weight increases, so does its variance. In intro stats and econometrics courses, one is trained to recognise this effect as heteroskedasticity, which violates one of the assumptions needed for ordinary least squares to be an optimal fitting algorithm and certain inferences from its results to be valid. The workaround usually taught in those same courses is to take logarithmic transforms of both variables. With many metrics common in the social sciences, this will turn a skewed distribution into one that at least resembles a Gaussian (‘Normal’) one. At the same time this conveniently turns your underlying model into one where the linear coefficients are elasticities, which have a nice interpretation (as exploited by me last week in examining how closely BMI matches real weight-height relationship): Here’s the code for those two charts (assumes you have run last week’s code first), and doing some setup for later: \#-------------prep - small additions to last week-------- \# Extra packages: library(broom) library(ggExtra) \# Set some reference levels for factor variables for better interpretation and stable estimates. \# Also take the chance to explicitly code some factors as missing so we get estimates for those \# people rather than dropping out of the model altogether: llcp\_releveled \% mutate(hhinc = fct\_explicit\_na(hhinc), education = fct\_explicit\_na(education), race = fct\_explicit\_na(race), age = fct\_explicit\_na(age)) \%{\textgreater}\% mutate(hhinc = fct\_relevel(hhinc, "\$25k to \$35k"), education = fct\_relevel(education, "Grade 12 GED")) \# specify survey design for use in invers-probability weighting in later GLM estimation llcp\_svy},

	abstract = {Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

However, educators might overlook metaphor theoretical developments that offer nuanced and testable perspectives on their pedagogical applications. This article introduces the notion of metaphor types—“correspondence” (CO) and “class inclusion” (CI)—as different strategic ways of presenting metaphors and reports an experimental study on their effectiveness in teaching basic regression to language and communication majors. Briefly, CO emphasizes systematic links while CI emphasizes holistic perceptions of similarity between the source and target of a metaphor. Both competency and attitudinal measures were compared in view of the latter’s importance as intended outcomes of the typical introductory course. The results show that while CO outperformed CI in assessments of manual calculations (e.g., SST/SSR/SSE/R2), CI outperformed CO in essay assessments requiring elaboration of general conceptual understanding. CI was also linked to more positive perceptions of the practical utility of regression analysis and its contribution to personal growth. Correlations between performance and attitudes were stronger in CO than CI, which further suggests CO’s greater perceived resemblance to a “rote learning” approach. The attendant implications are discussed in the growing context of general statistics education for nonstatistics majors. Directions for further research are suggested.},

Students expressed negative attitudes and concerns related to R at the beginning of the course, but most developed more positive attitudes after engaging with course materials, regardless of demographic characteristics or prior programming experience. Analysis of a subgroup of students revealed that change in attitudes toward R may be linked to students’ patterns of engagement over time and students’ perceptions of the learning environment.},

A planned comparison procedure that simplifies the tedious process of partitioning a contingency table by creating single-degree-of-freedom con trasts through a regression-based approach is proposed. Importantly, these post hoc methods supplement the analysis of standardized residuals by reporting the per centage contribution for each cell to the overall chi-square statistic (relative contri bution) and to the percentage of variance shared by the two factors (absolute contri bution). Both methods can be readily incorporated into existing statistical packages such as SAS or SPSS. The equivalence of the percentage contribution method to the more common standardized residual method is also presented along with an exam ple of a typical application.},

	abstract = {The examination of cross-classified category data is common in evaluation and research, with Karl Pearson's family of chi-square tests representing one of the most utilized statistical analyses for answering questions about the association or difference between categorical variables. Unfortunately, these tests are also among the more commonly misinterpreted statistical tests in the field. The problem is not that researchers and evaluators misapply the results of chi-square tests, but rather they tend to over interpret or incorrectly interpret the results, leading to statements that may have limited or no statistical support based on the analyses preformed., This paper attempts to clarify any confusion about the uses and interpretations of the family of chi-square tests developed by Pearson, focusing primarily on the chi-square tests of independence and homogeneity of variance (identity of distributions). A brief survey of the recent evaluation literature is presented to illustrate the prevalence of the chi-square test and to offer examples of how these tests are misinterpreted. While the omnibus form of all three tests in the Karl Pearson family of chi-square tests—independence, homogeneity, and goodness-of-fit,—use essentially the same formula, each of these three tests is, in fact, distinct with specific hypotheses, sampling approaches, interpretations, and options following rejection of the null hypothesis. Finally, a little known option, the use and interpretation of post hoc comparisons based on Goodman's procedure (Goodman, 1963) following the rejection of the chi-square test of homogeneity, is described in detail.},

                Biological data are often intrinsically hierarchical. Due to their ability to account for such dependencies, mixed-effects models have become a common analysis technique in ecology and evolution. While many questions around their theoretical foundations and practical applications are solved, one fundamental question is still highly debated: When facing a low number of levels should we model a grouping (blocking, clustering) variable as a random or fixed effect? In such situation, the variance of the random effect is imprecise, but whether this affects the statistical properties of the population effect is unclear.
              
              
                Here, we analyzed the consequences of including a grouping variable as fixed or random effect in the correctly specified and other possible miss-specified models (too simple or too complex models) for data with small number of levels (2 - 8). For all these options, we calculated type I error rates and power. Moreover, we show how these statistical properties change with the study design.
              
              
                We found that the model choice does not influence the statistical properties of the population effect when the effect is the same at all levels However, if an ecological effect differs among levels, using a random slope and intercept model, and switching to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit, avoids overconfidence in the results. Additionally, power and type I error are strongly influenced by the number of and difference between levels.
              
              
                We conclude that inferring the correct random effect structure is of high importance to get correct statistical properties. When in doubt, we recommend starting with the simpler model and using model diagnostics to identify missing components. When having identified the correct structure, we encourage to start with a mixed-effects model independent of the number of levels and switch to a fixed-effect model only in case of a singular fit. With these recommendations, we allow for more informative choices about study design and data analysis and thus make ecological inference with mixed-effects models more robust for small number of levels.},

	abstract = {In ecology and evolution generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are becoming increasingly used to test for differences in variation by treatment at multiple hierarchical levels. Yet, the specific sampling schemes that optimize the power of an experiment to detect differences in random effects by treatment/group remain unknown. In this paper we develop a blueprint for conducting power analyses for GLMMs focusing on detecting differences in variance by treatment. We present parameterization and power analyses for random-intercepts and random-slopes GLMMs because of their generality as focal parameters for most applications and because of their immediate applicability to emerging questions in the field of behavioral ecology. We focus on the extreme case of hierarchically structured binomial data, though the framework presented here generalizes easily to any error distribution model. First, we determine the optimal ratio of individuals to repeated measures within individuals that maximizes power to detect differences by treatment in among-individual variation in intercept, among-individual variation in slope, and within-individual variation in intercept. Second, we explore how power to detect differences in target variance parameters is affected by total variation. Our results indicate heterogeneity in power across ratios of individuals to repeated measures with an optimal ratio determined by both the target variance parameter and total sample size. Additionally, power to detect each variance parameter was low overall (in most cases {\textgreater}1,000 total observations per treatment needed to achieve 80\% power) and decreased with increasing variance in non-target random effects. With growing interest in variance as the parameter of inquiry, these power analyses provide a crucial component for designing experiments focused on detecting differences in variance. We hope to inspire novel experimental designs in ecology and evolution investigating the causes and implications of individual-level phenotypic variance, such as the adaptive significance of within-individual variation.},

My interest in them stems from the observation that within many spaces where large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live. Unsurprisingly, this lack of data typically correlates with issues affecting those who are most vulnerable in that context.

The word "missing" is inherently normative. It implies both a lack and an ought: something does not exist, but it should. That which should be somewhere is not in its expected place; an established system is disrupted by distinct absence. Just because some type of data doesn't exist doesn't mean it's missing, and the idea of missing data sets is inextricably tied to a more expansive climate of inevitable and routine data collection.},

	abstract = {The bootstrap and related resampling methods are
statistical techniques which can be used in place
of standard approximations for statistical inference.
The basic methods are very easily implemented
but for the methods to gain widespread acceptance
among users it is necessary that they be implemented
in standard statistical packages. In this article I will
describe the boot package which implements many
variants of resampling methods in R. The package
was originally written as an S-Plus library released
in conjunction with the book by Davison and Hink-
ley (1997). Subsequently the library was ported to
R by Brian Ripley. The boot package described here
is distinct from the limited suite of bootstrap func-
tions which are now included in S-Plus. It is also dis-
tinct from the bootstrap package originally written
by R. Tibshirani for Efron and Tibshirani (1993).
In this paper I describe the main components of
the boot package and their use. I will not go into
any theoretical detail about the methods described.
It is strongly recommended, however, that the user
read Davison and Hinkley (1997) before using the
package. Initially I will describe the basic function
for bootstrapping i.i.d. data and analyzing the boot-
strap output. Then I will describe functions for sam-
pling randomly right-censored data and time series
data. The availability of the bootstrap for such non-
standard cases is one of the major advantages of the
boot package.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to help empirical economists think through when and how to weight the data used in estimation. We start by distinguishing two purposes of estimation: to estimate population descriptive statistics and to estimate causal effects. In the former type of research, weighting is called for when it is needed to make the analysis sample representative of the target population. In the latter type, the weighting issue is more nuanced. We discuss three distinct potential motives for weighting when estimating causal effects: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity, (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling, and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does. We recommend diagnostics for assessing the advisability of weighting, and we suggest methods for appropriate inference.},

	abstract = {Meta-analysis and meta-regression are statistical methods for synthesizing and modelling the results of different studies, and are critical research synthesis tools in ecology and evolutionary biology (E\&E). However, many E\&E researchers carry out meta-analyses using software that is limited in its statistical functionality and is not easily updatable. It is likely that these software limitations have slowed the uptake of new methods in E\&E and limited the scope and quality of inferences from research syntheses. We developed OpenMEE: Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution to address the need for advanced, easy-to-use software for meta-analysis and meta-regression. OpenMEE has a cross-platform, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that gives E\&E researchers access to the diverse and advanced statistical functionalities offered in R, without requiring knowledge of R programming. OpenMEE offers a suite of advanced meta-analysis and meta-regression methods for synthesizing continuous and categorical data, including meta-regression with multiple covariates and their interactions, phylogenetic analyses, and simple missing data imputation. OpenMEE also supports data importing and exporting, exploratory data analysis, graphing of data, and summary table generation. As intuitive, open-source, free software for advanced methods in meta-analysis, OpenMEE meets the current and pressing needs of the E\&E community for teaching meta-analysis and conducting high-quality syntheses. Because OpenMEE's statistical components are written in R, new methods and packages can be rapidly incorporated into the software. To fully realize the potential of OpenMEE, we encourage community development with an aim to advance the capabilities of meta-analyses in E\&E.},

	abstract = {Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour, and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources. Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias: an instance of the Big Data Paradox1. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi–Facebook2,3 (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse4 (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi–Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14–20 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11–17 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios–Ipsos online panel5 with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices6 provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework1 to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition.},

	abstract = {Missing data (a) reside at three missing data levels of analysis (item-, construct-, and person-level), (b) arise from three missing data mechanisms (missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random) that range from completely random to systematic missingness, (c) can engender two missing data problems (biased parameter estimates and inaccurate hypothesis tests/inaccurate standard errors/low power), and (d) mandate a choice from among several missing data treatments (listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, single imputation, maximum likelihood, and multiple imputation). Whereas all missing data treatments are imperfect and are rooted in particular statistical assumptions, some missing data treatments are worse than others, on average (i.e., they lead to more bias in parameter estimates and less accurate hypothesis tests). Social scientists still routinely choose the more biased and error-prone techniques (listwise and pairwise deletion), likely due to poor familiarity with and misconceptions about the less biased/less error-prone techniques (maximum likelihood and multiple imputation). The current user-friendly review provides five easy-to-understand practical guidelines, with the goal of reducing missing data bias and error in the reporting of research results. Syntax is provided for correlation, multiple regression, and structural equation modeling with missing data.},

	abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {It is generally thought that increased human activity or infrastructure automatically translates to decreased wildlife activity or abundance. We surveyed dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) at fourteen urban parks with water features to determine factors that promote or hinder species richness or overall abundance. We constructed basic decision trees with either richness or abundance as a response variable and a suite of park characteristics (e.g., size, footprint of the water feature(s), habitat heterogeneity, presence and extent of infrastructure) as predictors. We found that the key predictor of both higher odonate richness and higher odonate abundance was the presence and extent of fishing activities. Despite higher human use at parks that promoted angling, as well as more infrastructure and increased management at these parks—factors that typically are thought to be correlated negatively with biodiversity—odonates and humans benefit from maintaining them and, we suggest, ensuring proper water quality persists. If it is good for fish, it is good for aquatic insects.},

Surveys allow us to draw on representative samples to learn about people’s beliefs, behaviors, and experiences—at least this is the goal for scientific research. Good survey design is complex and linked to a theoretical literature. This chapter looks into the complexities of what it takes to do good survey research. The survey instrument translates unobservable content (beliefs) into numerical or other empirical referents in order to observe patterns across a group of respondents. There are three distinct types of surveys: face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and self-administered questionnaires (that include online surveys). Survey construction is a scientific art—one must be able to write questions that measure the concepts that intend to measure, questions that take into account the population under study and questions that contain no biased language, no anchors, and no double-barreled questions.

	abstract = {In statistics, the principle of marginality is the fact that the average (or main) effects, of variables in an analysis are marginal to their interaction effect—that is, the main effect of one explanatory variable captures the effect of that variable averaged over all values of a second explanatory variable whose value influences the first variable's effect. The principle of marginality implies that, in general, it is wrong to test, estimate, or interpret main effects of explanatory variables where the variables interact or, similarly, to model interaction effects but delete main effects that are marginal to
them. While such models are interpretable, they lack applicability, as they ignore the dependence of a variable's effect upon another variable's value.
Nelder and Venables have argued strongly for the importance of this principle in regression analysis.},

	url = {https://david-baranger.shinyapps.io/InteractionPoweR_analytic/},
	abstract = {Interaction analyses (also termed ‘moderation’ analyses or ‘moderated multiple regression’) are a form of linear regression analysis designed to test whether the association between two variables changes when conditioned on a third variable. It can be challenging to perform a power analysis for interactions with existing software, particularly when variables are correlated and continuous. Moreover, while power is impacted by variable parameters that are always present in cross-sectional observational studies, such as reliability and skew, it can be unclear how to incorporate these effects into a power analysis. The R package InteractionPoweR and associated Shiny app allow researchers with minimal or no programming experience to perform analytic and simulation-based power analyses for interactions. At minimum, these analyses require the Pearson’s correlation between variables and sample size, and parameters including reliability, skew, and the number of discrete levels that a variable takes (e.g., binary or likert scale) can optionally be specified. In this Tutorial we demonstrate how to perform power analyses using our package and give examples of how power can be impacted by main effects, correlations between main effects, reliability, and variable distributions. We close with a brief discussion of how researchers may select an appropriate interaction effect size when performing a power analysis.},

	abstract = {As most ecosystems are being challenged by multiple, co-occurring stressors, an important challenge is to understand and predict how stressors interact to affect biological responses. A popular approach is to design factorial experiments that measure biological responses to pairs of stressors and compare the observed response to a null model expectation. Unfortunately, we believe experiment sample sizes are inadequate to detect most non-null stressor interaction responses, greatly hindering progress. Using both real and simulated data, we show sample sizes typical of many experiments ({\textless}6) can (i) only detect very large deviations from the additive null model, implying many important non-null stressor-pair interactions are being missed, and (ii) potentially lead to mostly statistical outliers being reported. Computer code that simulates data under either additive or multiplicative null models is provided to estimate statistical power for user-defined responses and sample sizes, and we recommend this is used to aid experimental design and interpretation of results. We suspect that most experiments may require 20 or more replicates per treatment to have adequate power to detect nonadditive. However, estimates of power need to be made while considering the smallest interaction of interest, i.e., the lower limit for a biologically important interaction, which is likely to be system-specific, meaning a general guide is unavailable. We discuss ways in which the smallest interaction of interest can be chosen, and how sample sizes can be increased. Our main analyses relate to the additive null model, but we show similar problems occur for the multiplicative null model, and we encourage similar investigations into the statistical power of other null models and inference methods. Without knowledge of the detection abilities of the statistical tools at hand or the definition of the smallest meaningful interaction, we will undoubtedly continue to miss important ecosystem stressor interactions.},

Annotated lesson notes within a lesson plan are a freely available resource to provide teachers support when navigating potentially unfamiliar statistics content and teaching practices. We identified several types of annotated lesson notes, created two statistics lesson plans that contained various annotated lesson notes, and observed secondary mathematics teachers implement the lesson plans in their intermediate algebra courses. For this study, we qualitatively investigated how two teachers’ instructional actions compared to what was prescribed in the annotated lesson notes. We found ways in which the teachers’ instructional actions, across their differing contexts, aligned with, varied from, or adapted to the annotated lesson notes. From these results, we highlight affordances and limitations of annotated lesson notes for statistics instruction and offer recommendations for those who create statistics curricula with annotated lesson notes.},

	abstract = {Measuring and comparing activity patterns provide key insights into the behavioral trade-offs that result in animal activity and their extrinsic and intrinsic drivers. Camera traps are a recently emerged source of data for sampling animal activity used to estimate activity patterns. However, nearly 70\% of studies using such data to estimate activity patterns apply a time-to-independence data filter to discard appreciable periods of sampling effort. This treatment of activity as a discrete event emerged from the use of camera trap data to estimate animal abundances, but does not reflect the continuous nature of behavior, and may bias resulting estimates of activity patterns. We used a large, freely available camera trap dataset to test the effects of time to independence on the estimated activity of eight medium- to large-sized African mammals. We show that discarding data through the use of time-to-independence filters causes substantial losses in sample sizes and differences in the estimated activity of species. Activity patterns estimated for herbivore species were more affected by the application of time-to-independence data filters than carnivores, this extending to estimates of potential interactions (activity overlap) between herbivore species. We hypothesize that this pattern could reflect the typically more abundant, social, and patch-specific foraging patterns of herbivores and suggest that this effect may bias estimates of predator–prey interactions. Activity estimates of rare species, with less data available, may be particularly vulnerable to loss of data through the application of time-to-independence data filters. We conclude that the application of time-to-independence data filters in camera trap-based estimates of activity patterns is not valid and should not be used.},

Recently, novel simulation techniques, advances in computing power, and numerical methods for implementing statistical models have significantly advanced our ability to integrate empirical and theoretical ecology. However, a divide still remains between mathematical and empirical studies, their readership, and integration into the broader literature. Because insights from mathematical ecology are far more general than the techniques employed, limitations in communicating mathematical advances to a broad spectrum of ecologists have arguably hindered ecology's progress, particularly in confronting theoretical predictions with empirical experiments and data. Here, we present a guide for both authors and readers of mathematical ecology, with the aim of increasing the accessibility of mathematical ecology for a broad group of ecologists.

	abstract = {Ecological processes such as seedling establishment, biotic interactions, and mortality can leave footprints on species spatial structure that can be detectable through spatial point-pattern analysis (SPPA). Being widely used in plant ecology, SPPA is increasingly carried out to describe biotic interactions and interpret pattern-process relationships. However, some aspects are still subjected to a non-negligible debate such as required sample size (in terms of the number of points and plot area), the link between the low number of points and frequently observed random (or independent) patterns, and relating patterns to processes. In this paper, an overview of SPPA is given based on rich and updated literature providing guidance for ecologists (especially beginners) on summary statistics, uni-/bi-/multivariate analysis, unmarked/marked analysis, types of marks, etc. Some ambiguities in SPPA are also discussed.},

By delivering high-quality weather data tools, regular classes, and continued follow-up support to its trained members, the OK-First program has empowered more than 1,800 public safety officials. Testimonials from OK-First users indicate that there is an immense value in providing nonscientific audiences with meteorological information and training. OK-First users have saved lives and property using the the program. There has been no quantitative analysis, however, that evaluates the value of the OK-First program. This study fills a gap in providing quantitative analysis for the economic value of the OK-First program. This research used a modified travel cost method to measure the value of information provided by the OK-First program to the users of the program. Results suggest that the average willingness to pay for OK-First is \$1,122 per training. The OK-First program in Oklahoma is valued at an estimated \$254,000, with a collective surplus of \$80,000 per training for OK-First users. This conservative estimate suggests the importance of programs such as the OK-First training, especially for public safety officials in Oklahoma.},

	abstract = {It is common practice in correlational or quasiexperimental studies to use statistical control to remove confounding effects from a regression coefficient. Controlling for relevant confounders can debias the estimated causal effect of a predictor on an outcome; that is, it can bring the estimated regression coefficient closer to the value of the true causal effect. But statistical control works only under ideal circumstances. When the selected control variables are inappropriate, controlling can result in estimates that are more biased than uncontrolled estimates. Despite the ubiquity of statistical control in published regression analyses and the consequences of controlling for inappropriate third variables, the selection of control variables is rarely explicitly justified in print. We argue that to carefully select appropriate control variables, researchers must propose and defend a causal structure that includes the outcome, predictors, and plausible confounders. We underscore the importance of causality when selecting control variables by demonstrating how regression coefficients are affected by controlling for appropriate and inappropriate variables. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for applied researchers who wish to use statistical control.},

	abstract = {A mathematical symbol is a figure or a combination of figures that is used to represent a mathematical object, an action on mathematical objects, a relation between mathematical objects, or for structuring the other symbols that occur in a formula. As formulas are entirely constituted with symbols of various types, many symbols are needed for expressing all mathematics.
The most basic symbols are the decimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and the letters of the Latin alphabet. The decimal digits are used for representing numbers through the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. Historically, upper-case letters were used for representing points in geometry, and lower-case letters were used for variables and constants. Letters are used for representing many other sorts of mathematical objects. As the number of these sorts has remarkably increased in modern mathematics, the Greek alphabet and some Hebrew letters are also used. In mathematical formulas, the standard typeface is italic type for Latin letters and lower-case Greek letters, and upright type for upper case Greek letters. For having more symbols, other typefaces are also used, mainly boldface

The use of Latin and Greek letters as symbols for denoting mathematical objects is not described in this article. For such uses, see Variable (mathematics) and List of mathematical constants. However, some symbols that are described here have the same shape as the letter from which they are derived, such as 
  
    
      
        
          ∏
          

          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}textstyle {\textbackslash}prod \{\}\}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          

          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}textstyle {\textbackslash}sum \{\}\}
  .
These letters alone are not sufficient for the needs of mathematicians, and many other symbols are used. Some take their origin in punctuation marks and diacritics traditionally used in typography; others by deforming letter forms, as in the cases of 
  
    
      
        ∈
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}in \}
   and 
  
    
      
        ∀
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}forall \}
  . Others, such as + and =, were specially designed for mathematics.},

	abstract = {Studies in behavioral ecology often investigate several traits and then apply multiple statistical tests to discover their pairwise associations. Traditionally, such approaches require the adjustment of individual significance levels because as more statistical tests are performed the greater the likelihood that Type I errors are committed (i.e., rejecting H0 when it is true) (Rice 1989). Bonferroni correction that lowers the critical P values for each particular test based on the number of tests to be performed is frequently used to reduce problems associated with multiple comparisons (Cabin and Mitchell 2000). However, this procedure dramatically increases the risk of committing Type II errors as it results in a high risk of not rejecting a H0 when it is false. To reach 80\% statistical power, it is necessary to have huge sample sizes to detect medium (r = 0.3 or d = 0.5; sensu Cohen 1988) or small (r = 0.1 or d = 0.2; sensu Cohen 1988) strength effects (e.g., say N = 128 or N = 788, respectively, for a 2-sample t-test), but sample size is often limited when studying behavior.},

Depending on the size of your browser window, you might have to adjust the display to find the distribution you are looking for. You may scroll the chart window or zoom in and out with the + and - buttons as needed.

	abstract = {Can a “nudge” toward engaging, fun, and useful material improve student attitudes toward statistics? We report on the results of a randomized study to assess the effect of a “nudge” delivered via a weekly E-mail digest on the attitudes of students enrolled in a large introductory statistics course taught in both flipped and fully online formats. Students were randomized to receive either a personalized weekly E-mail digest with course information and a “nudge” to read and explore interesting applications of statistics relevant to the weekly course material, or a generic course E-mail digest with the same course information, and no “nudge.” Our study found no evidence that “nudging” students to read and explore interesting applications of statistics resulted in better attitudes toward statistics.

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

Though some common strategies apply across these areas, this paper focuses on providing a framework for developing accessible and inclusive course materials (eg: in-class activities, course manuals, lecture slides, etc), with examples drawn from our experience co-writing a statistics textbook. In turn, this framework establishes a structure for holding ourselves accountable to these principles.},

	abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed.},

	abstract = {We quantiﬁed Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) site ﬁdelity and apparent survival across a 6 year period in an area undergoing shale gas development. Waterthrush initially exhibited high site ﬁdelity that declined over time. At the same time, the number of unpaired males defending territories increased as did natal ﬁdelity. We identiﬁed site ﬁdelity factors that inﬂuenced if adult males and females returned. More males returned either due to or regardless of amount of shale gas disturbance and lower riparian habitat quality. Females were less likely to return with increased number of breeding attempts. Females in shale gas disturbed areas had a higher number of breeding attempts and lower individual productivity. We saw a general nonsigniﬁcant trend in declining apparent survival over time. Overall apparent survival estimates for adult males (0.56) and females (0.44) were similar to those reported for other populations. Apparent survival candidate models suggested weak, positive relationships of increased survival with shale gas territory disturbance, disturbance with year, and year for adult males, and a positive relationship of increased survival with hydraulic fracturing runoff for adult females although regression coefﬁcients overlapped zero for all model-supported covariates implying no statistical signiﬁcance. Since waterthrush can maintain pair bonds from the previous year and females must pick a nest site within the defended male’s territory, there are potential conﬂicts between factors that inﬂuence adult survival and site ﬁdelity that may affect long-term population persistence. Our study adds to previous evidence that shale gas disturbed areas may serve as sink habitats. Received 11 October 2017. Accepted 31 July 2018.},

	abstract = {Agriculture of varying management intensity dominates fragmented tropical areas and differentially impacts organisms across and within taxa. We examined impacts of local and landscape characteristics on four groups of ants in an agricultural landscape in Chiapas, Mexico comprised of forest fragments and coffee agroecosystems varying in habitat quality. We sampled ground ants found in leaf litter and rotten logs and arboreal ants found in hollow coffee twigs and on tree trunks. Then using vegetation and agrochemical indices and conditional inference trees, we examined the relative importance of local (e.g. vegetation, elevation, agrochemical) and landscape variables (e.g. distance to and amount of nearby forest and rustic coffee) for predicting richness and abundance of ants. Leaf litter ant abundance increased with vegetation complexity; richness and abundance of ants from rotten logs, twig-nests, and tree trunks were not affected by vegetation complexity. Agrochemical use did not affect species richness or abundance of any ant group. Several local factors (including humus mass, degree of decay of logs, number of hollow twigs, tree circumference, and absence of fertilizers) were significant positive predictors of abundance and richness of some ant groups. Two landscape factors (forest within 200 m, and distance from forest) predicted richness and abundance of twig-nesting and leaf litter ants. Thus, different ant groups were influenced by different characteristics of agricultural landscapes, but all responded primarily to local characteristics. Given that ants provide ecosystem services (e.g. pest control) in coffee farms, understanding ant responses to local and landscape characteristics will likely inform farm management decisions.},

	abstract = {Environmental and biological context play significant roles in modulating physiological stress responses of individuals in wildlife populations yet are often overlooked when evaluating consequences of human disturbance on individual health and fitness. Furthermore, most studies gauge individual stress responses based on a single physiological biomarker, typically circulating glucocorticoid concentrations, which limits interpretation of the complex, multifaceted responses of individuals to stressors. We selected four physiological biomarkers to capture short-term and prolonged stress responses in a widespread cave-roosting bat, Hipposideros diadema, across multiple gradients of human disturbance in and around caves in the Philippines. We used conditional inference trees and random forest analysis to determine the role of environmental quality (cave complexity, available roosting area), assemblage composition (intra- and interspecific associations and species richness), and intrinsic characteristics of individuals (sex and reproductive status) in modulating responses to disturbance. Direct cave disturbance (hunting pressure and human visitation) was the primary driver of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios, with lower ratios associated with increased disturbance, while context-specific factors were more important in explaining total leukocyte count, body condition, and ectoparasite load. Moreover, conditional inference trees revealed complex interactions among human disturbance and modulating factors. Cave complexity often ameliorated individual responses to human disturbance, whereas conspecific abundance often compounded responses. Our study demonstrates the importance of an integrated approach that incorporates environmental and biological context when identifying drivers of physiological responses, and that assesses responses to gradients of direct and indirect disturbance using multiple complementary biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Numerous hypotheses have been developed to explain how a brood parasite selects a host nest into which it lays its eggs. Most hypotheses address various aspects of nest placement. We used an extensive dataset to tease apart the relative strength of various hypotheses associated with nest placement and timing. These data were from North American tallgrass prairie and included nearly 2,000 nests of 17 host species known to accept eggs of the brood parasitic Brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater. Regression tree analyses, with host species as a categorical covariate built around successive logistic regressions, implied that the “edge effect” and “perch proximity” hypotheses, the latter assessed as distance to woody vegetation, received the strongest support. Hypotheses concerning nest height, livestock proximity, habitat density, nest exposure, laying date, and host clutch size received weaker or subsidiary support, the latter meaning that the hypotheses received significant support only after edge effects or distance to woody vegetation were accounted for first. Host species was associated significantly with parasitism rate, but host species was itself correlated with various vegetation and landscape variables that we assessed. Brood parasitism rate and nest height were associated non-linearly. In addition to a clear hierarchical pattern among factors associated with rates of parasitism, several key explanatory variables had marked interactions, such as prairie edge and extent of woody vegetation or nest height and nest exposure. Such interactions, including between host species and certain landscape and vegetation variables, such as nest height and distance from woody vegetation, suggest caution is warranted when assessing the various competing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive.},

	abstract = {This tutorial discusses a recently developed methodology for causal inference based on longitudinal modiﬁed treatment policies (LMTPs). LMTPs generalize many commonly used parameters for causal inference including average treatment effects, and facilitate the mathematical formalization, identiﬁcation, and estimation of many novel parameters. LMTPs apply to a wide variety of exposures, including binary, multivariate, and continuous, as well as interventions that result in violations of the positivity assumption. LMTPs can accommodate time-varying treatments and confounders, competing risks, loss-to-follow-up, as well as survival, binary, or continuous outcomes. This tutorial aims to illustrate several practical uses of the LMTP framework, including describing different estimation strategies and their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. We provide numerous examples of types of research questions which can be answered within the proposed framework. We go into more depth with one of these examples—speciﬁcally, estimating the effect of delaying intubation on critically ill COVID-19 patients’ mortality. We demonstrate the use of the open-source R package lmtp to estimate the effects, and we provide code on https://github.com/kathoffman/lmtp-tutorial.},

	abstract = {Multiple comparisons tests (MCTs) include the statistical tests used to compare groups (treatments) often following a significant effect reported in one of many types of linear models. Due to a variety of data and statistical considerations, several dozen MCTs have been developed over the decades, with tests ranging from very similar to each other to very different from each other. Many scientific disciplines use MCTs, including {\textgreater}40,000 reports of their use in ecological journals in the last 60 years. Despite the ubiquity and utility of MCTs, several issues remain in terms of their correct use and reporting. In this study, we evaluated 17 different MCTs. We first reviewed the published literature for recommendations on their correct use. Second, we created a simulation that evaluated the performance of nine common MCTs. The tests examined in the simulation were those that often overlapped in usage, meaning the selection of the test based on fit to the data is not unique and that the simulations could inform the selection of one or more tests when a researcher has choices. Based on the literature review and recommendations: planned comparisons are overwhelmingly recommended over unplanned comparisons, for planned non-parametric comparisons the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U test is recommended, Scheffé’s S test is recommended for any linear combination of (unplanned) means, Tukey’s HSD and the Bonferroni or the Dunn-Sidak tests are recommended for pairwise comparisons of groups, and that many other tests exist for particular types of data.

	abstract = {Exposure to dust particles enriched with arsenic (As) is a significant health threat for populations living in Southeast Asian megacities. The mineralogical composition of dust particles is the key factor that controls the retention and release of As. This study investigated the degree of metal(oid)s pollution (As, Ca, Fe, K, Ga, Rb, Sr, Ti, V, Y, and Zr) in road dust of Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index suggested that the road dust was heavily enriched with As, which triggers a comprehensive investigation of its controlling mechanisms and potential health risks by combining physicochemical and mineralogical information with multivariate analysis and a simulated probabilistic risk estimation model. Alkaline road dust (pH1:5 ranges from 8.02 to 10.34) in Dhaka city was found to have significant enrichment of As. Dust alkalinity was possibly controlled by the presence of carbonate minerals, such as calcite. Quartz was identified as the dominant mineral phase followed by magnesium carbon arsenide (MgCAs2). Carbonate mineral driven alkaline pH conditions in road dust would potentially trigger the release and mobilization of As to the environment. However, organic complexation can stabilize As on particle surfaces. Monte Carlo simulation-based health risk forecast suggested that the probability of As associated cancer risk has greatly exceeded the threshold value of 1E-4 for adults and children, and children are more vulnerable than adults. According to sensitivity analysis, the concentration of As and exposure duration (ED) posed the most significant impact ({\textgreater}58\%) on risk estimation.},

            For most of the twentieth century through to the present day, statistics has been neatly divided into two theoretical frameworks: classical/frequentist and Bayesian. Scientists typically choose the statistical theoretical framework to analyze their data depending on the nature and complexity of the problem, and based on their personal views on probability and uncertainty. While textbooks and courses should reflect and anticipate this dual reality, they rarely do so. Scientists needing to employ the alternative statistical framework almost need to relearn from scratch. This book explains, discusses, and applies both the classical/frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks to fit the different types of generalized linear mixed models that allow the analysis of the types of data commonly gathered by researchers in the life sciences, incorporating the experimental or survey design, or, more generally, features of the data collection process. It presents material in an intuitive, approachable, and progressive manner suitable for research scientists and graduate students with only a very basic knowledge of calculus and statistics. The book covers the material in a theoretically rigorous manner, focusing on the practical application of all the methods to actual research data.},

	abstract = {Applied researchers often ﬁnd themselves making statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of ﬁxed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efﬁcient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

However, implementing a machine learning model is not yet a trivial task and may seem intimidating to ecologists with no previous experience in this area. Here we provide a series of tips to help ecologists in implementing machine learning models. We focus on classification problems as many ecological studies aim to assign data into predefined classes such as ecological states or biological entities. Each of the nine tips identifies a common error, trap or challenge in developing machine learning models and provides recommendations to facilitate their use in ecological studies.},

But applied researchers may sometimes not understand the underlying causal inference problems and thus endorse conclusions that rest on unrealistic assumptions. In this article, we aim to provide a clear explanation for the limited conditions under which standard procedures for mediation and moderation analysis can succeed. We discuss why reversing arrows or comparing model fit indices cannot tell us which model is the right one and how tests of conditional independence can at least tell us where our model goes wrong. Causal modeling practices in psychology are far from optimal but may be kept alive by domain norms that demand every article makes some novel claim about processes and boundary conditions. We end with a vision for a different research culture in which causal inference is pursued in a much slower, more deliberate, and collaborative manner.},

	abstract = {Many psychological researchers use some form of a visual diagram in their research processes. Model diagrams used with structural equation models (SEMs) and causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can guide causal-inference research. SEM diagrams and DAGs share visual similarities, often leading researchers familiar with one to wonder how the other differs. This article is intended to serve as a guide for researchers in the psychological sciences and psychiatric epidemiology on the distinctions between these methods. We offer high-level overviews of SEMs and causal DAGs using a guiding example. We then compare and contrast the two methodologies and describe when each would be used. In brief, SEM diagrams are both a conceptual and statistical tool in which a model is drawn and then tested, whereas causal DAGs are exclusively conceptual tools used to help guide researchers in developing an analytic strategy and interpreting results. Causal DAGs are explicitly tools for causal inference, whereas the results of a SEM are only sometimes interpreted causally. A DAG may be thought of as a “qualitative schematic” for some SEMs, whereas SEMs may be thought of as an “algebraic system” for a causal DAG. As psychology begins to adopt more causal-modeling concepts and psychiatric epidemiology begins to adopt more latent-variable concepts, the ability of researchers to understand and possibly combine both of these tools is valuable. Using an applied example, we provide sample analyses, code, and write-ups for both SEM and causal DAG approaches.},

	abstract = {"The book equips students with the end-to-end skills needed to do data science. That means gathering, cleaning, preparing, and sharing data, then using statistical models to analyse data, writing about the results of those models, drawing conclusions from them, and finally, using the cloud to put a model into production, all done in a reproducible way. At the moment, there are a lot of books that teach data science, but most of them assume that you already have the data. This book fills that gap by detailing how to go about gathering datasets, cleaning and preparing them, before analysing them. There are also a lot of books that teach statistical modelling, but few of them teach how to communicate the results of the models and how they help us learn about the world. Very few data science textbooks cover ethics, and most of those that do, have a token ethics chapter. Finally, reproducibility is not often emphasised in data science books. This book is based around a straight-forward workflow conducted in an ethical and reproducible way: gather data, prepare data, analyse data, and communicate those findings. This book will achieve the goals by working through extensive case studies in terms of gathering and preparing data, and integrating ethics throughout. It is specifically designed around teaching how to write about the data and models, so aspects such as writing are explicitly covered. And finally, the use of GitHub and the open-source statistical language R are built in throughout the book"--},

Here, we show that this can lead to sizable misperceptions about the implications of scientific results. Specifically, we present three preregistered, randomized experiments where participants saw the same scientific findings visualized as showing only inferential uncertainty, only outcome variability, or both and answered questions about the size and importance of findings they were shown. Our results, composed of responses from medical professionals, professional data scientists, and tenure-track faculty, show that the prevalent form of visualizing only inferential uncertainty can lead to significant overestimates of treatment effects, even among highly trained experts. In contrast, we find that depicting both inferential uncertainty and outcome variability leads to more accurate perceptions of results while appearing to leave other subjective impressions of the results unchanged, on average.},

	abstract = {1 The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57\% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2 The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3 We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4 An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

	abstract = {Statistical inference based on stepwise model selection is applied regularly in ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral research. In addition to fundamental shortcomings with regard to finding the “best” model, stepwise procedures are known to suffer from a multiple‐testing problem, yet the method is still widely used. As an illustration of this problem, we present results of a simulation study of artificial data sets of uncorrelated variables, with two to 10 predictor variables and one dependent variable. We then compared results from stepwise regression with a regression model in which all predictor variables were entered simultaneously. These analyses clearly demonstrate that significance tests based on stepwise procedures lead to greatly inflated Type I error rates (i.e., the probability of erroneously rejecting a true null hypothesis). By using a simple simulation design, our study amplifies previous warnings about using stepwise procedures, and we follow others in recommending that biologists refrain from applying these methods.},

	abstract = {In ecological and behavioral research, drawing reliable conclusions from statistical models with multiple predictors is usually difficult if all predictors are simultaneously in the model. The traditional way of handling multiple predictors has been the use of threshold-based removal-introduction algorithms, that is, stepwise regression, which currently receives considerable criticism. A more recent and increasingly propagated modelling method for multiple predictors is the information theoretic (IT) approach that quantifies the relative suitability of multiple, potentially non-nested models based on a balance of model fit and the accuracy of estimates. Here, we examine three shortcomings of stepwise regression, subjective critical values, model uncertainty, and parameter estimation bias, which have been suggested to be avoided by applying information theory. We argue that, in certain circumstances, the IT approach may be sensitive to these issues as well. We point to areas where further testing and development could enhance the performance of IT methods and ultimately lead to robust inferences in behavioral ecology.},

	abstract = {Previous studies found conflicting results on the importance of temperature and precipitation versus geochemical variables for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and trends with depth, and most utilized linear statistical models. To reconcile the controversy, we used data from 2574 mineral horizons from 675 pits from National Ecological Observatory Network sites across North America, typically collected to 1 m depth. Climate was a fundamental predictor of SOC and played similarly important roles as some geochemical predictors. Yet, this only emerged in the generalized additive mixed model and random forest model and was obscured in the linear mixed model. Relationships between water availability and SOC were strongest in very dry ecosystems and SOC increased most strongly at mean annual temperature {\textless} 0°C. In all models, depth, oxalate-extractable Al (Alox), pH, and exchangeable calcium plus exchangeable magnesium were important while silt + clay, oxalate-extractable Fe (Feox), and vegetation type were weaker predictors. Climate and pH were independently related to SOC and also interacted with geochemical composition: Feox and Alox related more strongly to SOC in wet or cold climates. Most predictors had nonlinear threshold relationships with SOC, and a saturating response to increasing reactive metals indicates soils where SOC might be limited by C inputs. We observed a mostly constant relative importance of geochemical and climate predictors of SOC with increasing depth, challenging previous statements. Overall, our findings challenge the notion that climate is redundant after accounting for geochemistry and demonstrate that considering their nonlinearities and interactions improves spatial predictions of SOC.},

	abstract = {Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results. Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn. In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions. In consequence of this work, our analysis demonstrates that variable importances [...].},

	abstract = {Researchers apply sampling weights to take account of unequal sample selection probabilities and to frame coverage errors and nonresponses. If researchers do not weight when appropriate, they risk having biased estimates. Alternatively, when they unnecessarily apply weights, they can create an inefﬁcient estimator without reducing bias. Yet in practice researchers rarely test the necessity of weighting and are sometimes guided more by the current practice in their ﬁeld than by scientiﬁc evidence. In addition, statistical tests for weighting are not widely known or available. This article reviews empirical tests to determine whether weighted analyses are justiﬁed. We focus on regression models, though the review’s implications extend beyond regression. We ﬁnd that nearly all weighting tests fall into two categories: difference in coefﬁcients tests and weight association tests. We describe the distinguishing features of each category, present their properties, and explain the close relationship between them. We review the simulation evidence on their sampling properties in ﬁnite samples. Finally, we highlight the unanswered theoretical and practical questions that surround these tests and that deserve further research.},

Topics covered include unequal weighting effects on variance estimates, the importance of descriptive assessments of the survey weights, whether weights are informative, to weight or not to weight when fitting regression models, testing the need for weights when fitting regression models, and more general weighting approaches for non-probability samples. Example software code will be included where relevant.

Vast dust deposits are well recognized from the late Paleozoic and provisionally implicated in primary production through Fe fertilization. Here, we document dust impacts on marine primary productivity in Moscovian (Pennsylvanian, ca. 307 Ma) and Asselian (Permian, ca. 295 Ma) carbonate strata from peri-Gondwanan terranes of Iran. Autotrophic contents of samples, detected by both point-count and lipid-biomarker analyses, track concentrations of highly reactive Fe, consistent with the hypothesis that dust stimulated primary productivity, also promoting carbonate precipitation. Additionally, highly reactive Fe tracks the fine-dust fraction. Dust-borne Fe fertilization increased organic and inorganic carbon cycling in low- and mid-latitude regions of Pangaea, maintaining low pCO2.},

	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is often used to help understand and manage ecological systems by assessing how a constant change in vital rates or other model parameters might affect the management outcome. This allows the manager to identify the most favorable course of action. However, realistic changes are often localized in time—for example, a short period of culling leads to a temporary increase in the mortality rate over the period. Hence, knowing when to act may be just as important as knowing what to act on. In this article, we introduce the method of time-dependent sensitivity analysis (TDSA) that simultaneously addresses both questions. We illustrate TDSA using three case studies: transient dynamics in static disease transmission networks, disease dynamics in a reservoir species with seasonal life history events, and endogenously driven population cycles in herbivorous invertebrate forest pests. We demonstrate how TDSA often provides useful biological insights, which are understandable on hindsight but would not have been easily discovered without the help of TDSA. However, as a caution, we also show how TDSA can produce results that mainly reflect uncertain modeling choices and are therefore potentially misleading. We provide guidelines to help users maximize the utility of TDSA while avoiding pitfalls.},

	abstract = {– Despite the elevated importance of Data Science in Statistics, there exists limited research investigating how students learn the computing concepts and skills necessary for carrying out data science tasks. Computer Science educators have investigated how students debug their own code and how students reason through foreign code. While these studies illuminate different aspects of students’ programming behavior or conceptual understanding, a method has yet to be employed that can shed light on students’ learning processes. This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this paper we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students’ computing code. Drawing on the Block Model (Schulte, 2008) to frame our analysis, we explore two types of research questions which could be posed about students’ learning.},

However, some journals in biomedical and psychosocial sciences ask for power analysis for data already collected and analysed before accepting manuscripts for publication. In this report, post hoc power analysis for retrospective studies is examined and the informativeness of understanding the power for detecting significant effects of the results analysed, using the same data on which the power analysis is based, is scrutinised. Monte Carlo simulation is used to investigate the performance of posthoc power analysis.},

	abstract = {Problems that occur when common methods (e.g. maximum likelihood and L-moments) for fitting a generalised Pareto (GP) distribution are applied to discrete (rounded) data sets are revealed by analysing the real, dry spell duration series. The analysis is subsequently performed on generalised Pareto time series obtained by systematic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The solution depends on the following: (1) the actual amount of rounding, as determined by the actual data range (measured by the scale parameter, σ) vs. the rounding increment (Δx), combined with; (2) applying a certain (sufficiently high) threshold and considering the series of excesses instead of the original series. For a moderate amount of rounding (e.g. σ/Δx ≥ 4), which is commonly met in practice (at least regarding the dry spell data), and where no threshold is applied, the classical methods work reasonably well. If cutting at the threshold is applied to rounded data—which is actually essential when dealing with a GP distribution—then classical methods applied in a standard way can lead to erroneous estimates, even if the rounding itself is moderate. In this case, it is necessary to adjust the theoretical location parameter for the series of excesses. The other solution is to add an appropriate uniform noise to the rounded data (Bso-called{\textasciicircum} jittering). This, in a sense, reverses the process of rounding; and thereafter, it is straightforward to apply the common methods. Finally, if the rounding is too coarse (e.g. σ/Δx{\textasciitilde}1), then none of the above recipes would work; and thus, specific methods for rounded data should be applied.},

	abstract = {Using software to teach statistical inference in introductory courses opens the door for methods and practices that are more conceptually appealing to students. With an increasing number of fields requiring competency in statistics including data science, natural and social sciences, public health and more, it is crucial that we as instructors deliver the basic concepts of statistics effectively. In line with guidelines presented in the GAISE College Report, this article demonstrates intuitive approaches to teaching proportion and mean inference that take advantage of statistical software and emphasize conceptual understanding. The article recommends putting aside asymptotic-based methods for proportion inference and using the exact binomial method. Regarding mean inference, we propose a more contextualized and simplified process that uses the distribution of the sample mean directly and avoids standardized statistics such as z or t. In both the proportion and mean inference contexts, we discuss the benefits of the proposed approaches and provide detailed examples that demonstrate the methods using the Rguroo statistical software.},

	abstract = {The modern ecologist usually works in both the field and laboratory, uses statistics and computers, and often works with ecological concepts that are model-based, if not model-driven. How do we make the field and laboratory coherent? How do we link models and data? How do we use statistics to help experimentation? How do we integrate modeling and statistics? How do we confront multiple hypotheses with data and assign degrees of belief to different hypotheses? How do we deal with time series (in which data are linked from one measurement to the next) or put multiple sources of data into one inferential framework? These are the kinds of questions asked and answered by The Ecological Detective . Ray Hilborn and Marc Mangel investigate ecological data much as a detective would investigate a crime scene by trying different hypotheses until a coherent picture emerges. The book is not a set of pat statistical procedures but rather an approach. The Ecological Detective makes liberal use of computer programming for the generation of hypotheses, exploration of data, and the comparison of different models. The authors' attitude is one of exploration, both statistical and graphical. The background required is minimal, so that students with an undergraduate course in statistics and ecology can profitably add this work to their tool-kit for solving ecological problems.},

	abstract = {Background: Audience segmentation strategies are of increasing interest to public health professionals who wish to identify easily defined, mutually exclusive population subgroups whose members share similar characteristics that help determine participation in a health-related behavior as a basis for targeted interventions. Classification and regression tree (C\&amp;RT) analysis is a nonparametric decision tree methodology that has the ability to efficiently segment populations into meaningful subgroups. However, it is not commonly used in public health. Purpose: This study provides a methodological overview of C\&amp;RT analysis for persons unfamiliar with the procedure. Methods and Results: An example of a C\&amp;RT analysis is provided and interpretation of results is discussed. Results are validated with those obtained from a logistic regression model that was created to replicate the C\&amp;RT findings. Results obtained from the example C\&amp;RT analysis are also compared to those obtained from a common approach to logistic regression, the stepwise selection procedure. Issues to consider when deciding whether to use C\&amp;RT are discussed, and situations in which C\&amp;RT may and may not be beneficial are described. Conclusions: C\&amp;RT is a promising research tool for the identification of at-risk populations in public health research and outreach.},

	abstract = {When data are not normally distributed, researchers are often uncertain whether it is legitimate to use tests that assume Gaussian errors, or whether one has to either model a more specific error structure or use randomization techniques. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the pros and cons of fitting Gaussian models to non-normal data in terms of risk of type I error, power and utility for parameter estimation. We find that Gaussian models are robust to non-normality over a wide range of conditions, meaning that p values remain fairly reliable except for data with influential outliers judged at strict alpha levels. Gaussian models also performed well in terms of power across all simulated scenarios. Parameter estimates were mostly unbiased and precise except if sample sizes were small or the distribution of the predictor was highly skewed. Transformation of data before analysis is often advisable and visual inspection for outliers and heteroscedasticity is important for assessment. In strong contrast, some non-Gaussian models and randomization techniques bear a range of risks that are often insufficiently known. High rates of false-positive conclusions can arise for instance when overdispersion in count data is not controlled appropriately or when randomization procedures ignore existing non-independencies in the data. Hence, newly developed statistical methods not only bring new opportunities, but they can also pose new threats to reliability. We argue that violating the normality assumption bears risks that are limited and manageable, while several more sophisticated approaches are relatively error prone and particularly difficult to check during peer review. Scientists and reviewers who are not fully aware of the risks might benefit from preferentially trusting Gaussian mixed models in which random effects account for non-independencies in the data.},

	abstract = {Personalized educational interventions have been shown to facilitate successful and inclusive statistics, mathematics, and data science (SMDS) in higher education through timely and targeted reduction of heterogeneous training disparities caused by years of cumulative, structural challenges in contemporary educational systems. However, the burden on the institutions and instructors to provide personalized training resources to large groups of students is also formidable, and often unsustainable. We present Individualized Pathways and Resources to Adaptive Control Theory-Inspired Scientific Education (iPRACTISE), a free, publicly available web app that serves as a tool to facilitate personalized trainings on SMDS and related topics through provision of personalized training recommendations as informed by computerized assessments and individuals’ training preferences. We describe the resources available in iPRACTISE, and some proof-of-concept evaluation results from deploying iPRACTISE to supplement in-person and online classroom teaching in real-life settings. Strengths, practical difficulties, and potentials for future applications of iPRACTISE to crowdsource and sustain personalized SMDS education are discussed.},
