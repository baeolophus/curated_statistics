# (PART) Questions about your goals {-} 
# What is your goal?

## Exploratory or hypothesis generation

## Inferential or hypothesis testing "Are things different"

This is a hypothesis, not a description.  Description can highlight, but doesn't test what's different.  Descriptions can still have a bias (mean vs median vs range all show different things descriptively, PCA problems).  Doesn't mean it's an experiment.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Physical or mechanistic predictions - you can only statistics them away sometimes

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
