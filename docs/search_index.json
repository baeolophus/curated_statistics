A plainer-language explanation of how splits are chosen with a sample dataset on irises and some exerpts from ctree documentation. 3.8.2 Examples of CART in the wild These two papers use R’s ctree() from the partykit package Available through OU’s subscriptions Available via Interlibrary Loan Access OU’s Interlibrary Loan Article Request Form A different algorithm to run CART: I suggest it because it has good figures and methods section 3.8.3 How and why to run the ctree version of CART/decision trees A short explanation of why ctree is a good general choice to minimize overfitting. The R vignette for the partykit package provides worked examples and code for both categorical responses (classification trees) and numeric responses (regression trees). ggparty allows for fancier and more informative plots Another example using ggparty with a published dataset "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
