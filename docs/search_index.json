The log odds must be converted to odds ratios, or their Poisson similar cousin relative risk/relative odds. You can present both the original log odds estimate plus the odds ratio / relative risk (Perraillon, n.d.) in your results table. UCLA’s Statistics Center has an overview (“FAQ: How Do I Interpret Odds Ratios in Logistic Regression?” n.d.) for logistic regression that goes from probabilities to odds to log odds to odds ratios. Helpfully, they show examples for a variety of types of predictor variables (none, categorical, numeric, interactions). 3.6.2 More technical 3.6.2.1 Questions and data types Example problem structures and types of data you need. The whole analysis page (“Poisson Regression | R Data Analysis Examples” n.d.), specifically look at the secion called “Poisson regression” about halfway down the page and the second bullet point for interpreting coefficients specifically. The whole analysis page (“Logit Regression | R Data Analysis Examples” n.d.), section where it will talk about coefficients. (Hector 2015) has a good overview of conversion on pp 130-134 for binary/logistic and 137-138 for Poisson data. Box 13.2 in Quinn and Keough also has a good work-through (logistic regression, but as long as both use the default log link the interpretation is similar). 3.6.2.2 Key assumptions Did you run a generalized linear model (GLM Monica (2013)) with a log link or logit link? Then yes. 3.6.2.3 Key distinctions among related methods Odds ratio for logistic vs relative risk for Poisson (DWin 2011). There is a good summary chapter about odds ratios vs log odds vs other related confusing terms. 3.6.2.4 Implementations and controversies Very helpful to plot your data (Cameron 2021) so you are interpreting in the correct direction, as for any type of regression. 3.6.3 Most technical Full explanation of the equations used to calculate and differences among odds ratios, probability, relative risk (Perraillon and Lindrooth, n.d.) 3.7 Examples “in the wild” Citations and what is useful in the paper.
