# Explaining Odds Ratios {-}

## Explanation
### The basics
In some regression models (examples here are logistic and Poisson regression), instead of a beta coefficient that can be interpreted as-is (unit of predictor change results in coefficient amount of response change), you are given log odds [@dwinAnswerHowInterpret2011].  The log odds must be converted to odds ratios, or their Poisson similar cousin relative risk/relative odds.  You can present both the original log odds estimate plus the odds ratio / relative risk [@perraillonInterpretingModelEstimates] in your results table.

UCLA's Statistics Center has an overview [@FAQHowInterpret] for logistic regression that goes from probabilities to odds to log odds to odds ratios. Helpfully, they show examples for a variety of types of predictor variables (none, categorical, numeric, interactions).


### More technical

#### Questions and data types
Example problem structures and types of data you need.

- The whole analysis page [@PoissonRegressionData], specifically look at the secion called "Poisson regression" about halfway down the page and the second bullet point for interpreting coefficients specifically.

- The whole analysis page [@LogitRegressionData], section where it will talk about coefficients.

- [@hector9GeneralizedLinear2015] has a good overview of conversion on pp 130-134 for binary/logistic and 137-138 for Poisson data.

- Box 13.2 in Quinn and Keough also has a good work-through (logistic regression, but as long as both use the default log link the interpretation is similar).

#### Key assumptions
Did you run a generalized linear model (GLM @monicaAnswerHowDoes2013) with a log link or logit link?  Then yes.

#### Key distinctions among related methods
Odds ratio for logistic vs relative risk for Poisson [@dwinAnswerHowInterpret2011].
There is a good summary chapter about odds ratios vs log odds vs other related confusing terms.

#### Implementations and controversies

Very helpful to plot your data [@cameronAnswerHowCan2021] so you are interpreting in the correct direction, as for any type of regression.
